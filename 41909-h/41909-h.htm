<h1 title="">THE CRIMSON THREAD</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />TWO HOURS BEFORE MIDNIGHT</h2>
<p>Starting back with a suppressed exclamation
of surprise on her lips, Lucile Tucker stared
in mystification and amazement. What was this
ghost-like apparition that had appeared at the
entrance to the long dark passage-way? A young
woman&rsquo;s face, a face of beauty and refinement,
surrounded by a perfect circle of white. In the
almost complete darkness of the place, that was
all Lucile could see. And such a place for such
a face&mdash;the far corner of the third floor of one
of the largest department stores in the world.
At that very moment, from somewhere out of
the darkness, came the slow, deep, chiming notes
of a great clock telling off the hour of ten. Two
hours before midnight! And she, Lucile, was
for a moment alone; or at least up to this moment
she had thought herself alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>What was she to make of the face? True, it
was on the level with the top of the wrapper&rsquo;s
desk. That, at least, was encouraging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That white is a fox skin, the collar to some
dark garment that blends completely with the
shadows,&rdquo; Lucile told herself reassuringly.</p>
<p>At that moment a startling question sent her
shrinking farther into the shadows. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s
a real person and not a spectre, what is she doing
here? Here, of all places, at the hour of
ten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was puzzling. What had this lady been
doing in that narrow passage? She could not
be a member of the working force of the store.
No sales person would come to work in such a
superb garment as this person wore. Although
Lucile had been employed in the book department
for but ten days, she had seen all those who
worked here and was certain enough that no such
remarkably beautiful face could have escaped her
notice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;why she might be anything,&rdquo; Lucile
told herself. &ldquo;A&mdash;thief&mdash;a shoplifter. Perhaps
she stole that very cape&mdash;or whatever it
is she wears. Perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly her heart gave a leap. Footsteps
were approaching. The next instant she saw a
second face appear in the narrow line of light
which the street lights cast through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laurie Seymour,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>Laurie was the new man in the department.
He had been working at the boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; books
for only three days, yet Lucile liked him, liked
him tremendously. He was so friendly, even-tempered
and different. And he seemed a trifle
mysterious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysterious,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;perhaps here&rsquo;s the
mystery answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It certainly did seem so, for after the apparition
in white had whispered a word or two, Laurie
looked at her strangely for a second, drew from
his pocket a slip of paper and handing it to
her, quickly vanished into the shadows. The
next instant the apparition vanished, too. Again
Lucile found herself alone in the far corner of
the mammoth store, surrounded by darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Perhaps you have been wondering what Lucile
and Laurie were doing in the great store
at this hour. Since the doors are closed at six
o&rsquo;clock, you have no doubt thought of the entire
place as being shrouded in darkness and utterly
deserted. These were the days of the great rush
of sales that comes before Christmas. That evening
eight thousand books had been trucked into
the department to be stowed away on or under
tables and shelves. Twenty sales persons had
been given &ldquo;pass outs&rdquo;; which meant that they
might pass <i>in</i> at seven o&rsquo;clock and work until
ten. They had worked like beavers; making
ready for the rush that would come on the
morrow.</p>
<p>Now the great bulk of the work had been done.
More than half of the workers had chirped a
cheery &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; and had found their way
down a marble stairway to the ground floor and
the street. Lucile had been sent by &ldquo;Rennie,&rdquo;
the head sales-lady of juveniles, to this dark section
for an armful of books. Here in this dark
corner a part of Laurie&rsquo;s true character had,
uninvited, come to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He gave her his pass-out,&rdquo; she said to herself.
&ldquo;With that she can leave the building
with her stolen goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second, as she thought of this, she contemplated
following the mystery woman and
bringing her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;would be dangerous.
That passage is a hundred feet long
and only four feet wide; then it turns sharply
and goes two hundred feet farther. She may
carry a knife; such women do. In that place
she could murder me and no one would know
until morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the other
end of the passage where it comes out at the
offices. She must leave the passage there if she
does not come back this way. I might call the
watchmen. They could catch her. It&rsquo;s a perfect
trap; she&rsquo;s like a mouse in a boot. But
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>She paused in her mad rush of thought. What
proof had she that this beautiful creature was
a thief? What indeed? And what right had
she to spy upon her and upon Laurie? Truth
was, she had none at all. She was a sales person,
not a detective. Her job was that of putting
books on shelves and tables and selling them;
her immediate task that of taking an armful of
books to Rennie. Her simple and sole duty lay
just there. Then, too, in the short time she had
known Laurie Seymour, she had come to like
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be innocent of any real wrong,&rdquo;
she reasoned. &ldquo;If I go blundering into things
I may be serving a friend badly indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she was brought up short by a sudden
thought, &ldquo;if he gave her his pass-out, how&rsquo;s
he to leave the building?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>How indeed? In a great store such as this,
where hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
of rare jewels and much silver and gold are kept
and where princely furs and priceless old paintings
are on display, it is necessary to maintain
a constant vigil against thieves. &ldquo;Pass-outs&rdquo;
are given to all employees who enter or leave the
store after closing hours. It was true enough
that without his pass-out, Laurie could not get
by the eagle-eyed guard who kept constant vigil
at the only door where the employees were permitted
to pass out to the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the books,&rdquo; she murmured, starting up,
&ldquo;Rennie will be waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rennie, whose real name was Miss Renton, appeared
to be in no hurry. Having become interested
in writing down lists of books that were
to be ordered in the morning, she had so far
forgotten the girl as to exclaim as she came up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lucile! I thought you had gone!
Now, dearie, just put those books down right
there. We can take care of them before the
rush begins in the morning. Run along now
and get your coat. You must go home. It&rsquo;s
past ten, less than two hours till midnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Lucile checked herself just in time. She had
been about to say that she was afraid to go for
her coat. And indeed she was, for was it not
hanging on the wall in that narrow passage at the
door of which the mystery lady had appeared?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t do to tell,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
got to go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Go she did, but with much fear and trembling.</p>
<p>She might have spared herself all this trembling,
for there was no one in the dark passage.</p>
<p>But what was this? The row of coat hooks
were all empty save one, her own, and on that
hook&mdash;what could it mean?&mdash;on that hook
hung not her own too frankly thin and threadbare
coat, but a magnificent thing of midnight
blue and white. It was the cape with the white
fox collar worn by the mystery woman.</p>
<p>Even as her hand touched the fox skin she
knew it was far more costly than she had
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over my coat,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only
to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, she found, was not true. <i>Her coat had
vanished.</i> The cape had been left in its stead
and, as if to further perplex and alarm her, the
midnight blue unfolded, revealing a superb lining
of Siberian squirrel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Lucile exclaimed as her trembling fingers
dropped to her side and she fled the place.</p>
<p>One consoling thought flashed across her mind.
Rennie had not yet left for the night. Rennie,
the tall and slim, with a thread of gray in her
black hair, who had been in the department for
no one knew how long&mdash;Rennie would know
what to do. The instant she was told all that
had happened she would say what the very next
step must be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The instant she is told,&rdquo; Lucile whispered to
herself. Then suddenly she realized that she did
not wish to tell all she had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet, at any rate,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supposed to have seen it. I want time
to think. I&rsquo;ll tell Rennie only what I am supposed
to know&mdash;that my coat has been taken
and this cape left in its stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rennie showed little surprise on hearing the
story. &ldquo;Someone has probably taken the wrong
coat,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not possible!&rdquo; Lucile laughed at
the very thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; and she dashed back for the
cape.</p>
<p>As Rennie saw the magnificent creation, she
gasped with astonishment; then began to murmur
something about fairy princesses looking
after poor girls and leaving them gorgeous garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go home without a wrap,&rdquo; she
told Lucile. &ldquo;They say there&rsquo;s a regular blizzard
outside. You&rsquo;ll simply have to wear it
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the garment from Lucile&rsquo;s hands, she
placed it upon her shoulders with a touch that
was half caress. Then, having fastened it under
Lucile&rsquo;s chin, she stood back to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dearie, you look charming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but how am I to get out of the building
with it? No one will believe that a mere
sales girl owns a cape like this. It&rsquo;s new. Probably
it&rsquo;s been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo; exclaimed Rennie. &ldquo;What nonsense!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added in a quieter tone, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not quite new. The strings that hold it together
at the throat are worn a little smooth and there&rsquo;s
the least bit of a soil at the bottom. You wait
ten minutes for me and we&rsquo;ll go out together. I
know the watchman. I&rsquo;ll take you out under my
wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly relieved by these words and intent on
making the most of her wait by having a good
general look at the room, Lucile sauntered away
to the left where she was soon lost from sight
behind tables, stacks of books, and massive pillars.</p>
<p>Since she had worked here but ten days, the
charm of the place had not yet worn off. The
books, row on row of them, fascinated her. Here
was a wealth of learning that no one could hope
to appropriate in a lifetime. To the right of
her was poetry, thousands of volumes; to the
left, books on travel, thousands more; and before
her new fiction, tens of thousands. Who
would not envy her? It was a great place for
one who loved books.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>With a feeling of sorrow she thought of the
time when she must leave all this wealth; when
she must say goodbye to the wonderful friends
she had already formed here. In two short
weeks she would be going back to the University.
Since she was dependent upon her own resources
for her support&mdash;and since for one who specialized
in English there was quite as much to
be learned about books by selling as by reading
them&mdash;her head professor had quite readily
granted her a month&rsquo;s leave of absence that she
might come down here to assist in meeting the
Christmas rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;it will be of the past
in two more weeks. But in two weeks much
may happen. Think of what happened to-night!
Think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>She was brought up short by a sound. Had
it been a footstep? She could not make sure
for the floor was heavily carpeted. Instantly she
became conscious of the darkness that surrounded
her like a shroud. Before her loomed
the dim outlines of the elevator cages. Distorted
by the uncertain light, these seemed the cells of
some gloomy prison. Far off to the right was
a great rotunda. From the rail that surrounded
this, when the lights were on, one might gaze
upward to dizzy heights and downward to dizzier
depths. Now she thought of that awe inspiring
vault as if it were some deep and mysterious
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ooo!&rdquo; Lucile gasped. &ldquo;This place gets
spookier every moment. I&rsquo;ll go back to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she spoke she caught a sound to her
right. Impelled by sheer curiosity, she took a
dozen steps in that direction.</p>
<p>Suddenly she started back. Against the wall
a light had flashed on for a second and in that
second she had caught sight of a face&mdash;the face
of Laurie Seymour.</p>
<p>Again the light came on. This time the flash
was a little longer. She saw his face clearly.
On his finely cut features there was such a smile
as suggests anticipation of amusing adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>In one hand he held the flashlight. Under
his arm was a bundle of corrugated paper such
as is used in wrapping books for mailing. He
was standing by a square opening in the wall.
Lucile knew in a vague sort of way where that
opening led. Books that had been wrapped were
dropped in there. A circular spiral chute, some
three feet in diameter, wormed its way like an
auger hole down from this point to the sub-basement
where was located the shipping room.</p>
<p>Even as she thought this through she saw
Laurie swing his feet across the opening. Then,
just as the light flashed out, she again saw that
amused grin. The next second there came the
sound of some heavy object gliding downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he went down the chute!&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long she stood there, petrified with surprise
and dread, she could not have told. It
could not have been many seconds but it seemed
an hour. At last the end came, a sickening thud
sounding faint and far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Without uttering a sound, but with heart beating
wildly and feet flying at almost superhuman
speed, the girl raced across the room and down
a flight of broad marble stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must find him. He is hurt. Perhaps he
is killed!&rdquo; she kept repeating to herself.</p>
<p>Down one flight; down two; three; four, she
sped.</p>
<p>And then, in the darkness of this vast shipping
room, she paused to listen.</p>
<p>Not a sound. She may as well have been
alone in the catacombs of Egypt or the Mammoth
Cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be this way,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>Truth was, she had lost her sense of direction.
She was not sure which way to go. She took
a dozen steps forward. Finding herself confronted
by a dark bulk, she started walking round
it. Having paused to think, she found fear gripping
at her heart. When she tried to retrace
her steps she discovered that the stairs had apparently
vanished. She was lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Lost in the subbasement
of this great building at night!&rdquo; Even
as she thought this there came to her, faint and
far distant, yet very distinct, the even tread of
footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Laurie. He doesn&rsquo;t walk like that.
It&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; her heart stood still, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a watchman!
And here I am dressed in this magnificent
garment which does not belong to me. Somehow
I must get back to the third floor and to Rennie!
But how? How!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />CRIMSON WITH A STRAND OF PURPLE</h2>
<p>Panic, an unbelievable terror ten times
stronger than her will, seized Lucile and bore
her fleetly down a dark, unknown aisle. The
very thought of being discovered by a watchman
unknown to her, mingled with the sensation
of the fear of darkness, had driven her
well-nigh frantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cape,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;I
must not be found with the cape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she but possessed the power to reason
quietly, she might have known that the watchman,
searching for an explanation of her strange
conduct, would, upon her suggesting it, take her
back to the third floor and Rennie. Not being
in full possession of these powers, she abandoned
herself to panic. Snatching the cape from her
shoulders she thrust it under her arm and
plunged on into the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>In the deeper shadows she saw dim forms
looming up before her. Some seemed giants
ready to reach out and grasp her; some wild
creatures poised to fall upon her from the dark.</p>
<p>Now she tripped and went sprawling. As she
sprang to her feet she caught the gleam of a
light. Thinking it the watchman&rsquo;s flashlight, she
was away like the wind.</p>
<p>At last pausing for breath, she listened. At
first she heard only the beating of her own heart.
Then, faint and far away, came the mellow
chimes of the great clock announcing the arrival
of half past ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half past ten!&rdquo; she whispered in consternation.
&ldquo;Rennie will leave. The place will be in
darkness and I shall be lost! What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she caught a faint gleam of light.
Watching it for a moment, and seeing that it
was steady and constant, she dared to creep
toward it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Drawing nearer, she saw that it came drifting
down an elevator shaft from some place a long
way above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elevator is there. The door is open!&rdquo;
she said to herself in surprise. &ldquo;And there is
no one in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, as she strained her ears to listen,
she caught again that heavy, even tread of the
watchman.</p>
<p>Our nerves are strange masters. A great general
is thrown into panic at sight of a cat; a
woman of national fame goes into convulsions
at sight of rippling water on the sea. As for
Lucile, at that moment nothing could have so
overthrown her whole mental balance as that
steady tramp-tramp of the watchman.</p>
<p>This time it drove her to the most curious
action. As a wild animal, driven, winded, cornered,
will sometimes dash into the very trap
that has been set for him, so this girl, leaping
forward, entered the elevator cage.</p>
<p>Had there been more time, it may have been
that her scattered wits returning would have told
her that here, where the dim light set out her
whole form in profile, was the most dangerous
spot of all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Before she had time to think of this the elevator
gave a sudden lurch and started upward.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more startling. Lucile
had never seen an elevator ascend without
an operator at the levers and she naturally believed
it could not be done; yet here she was in
the cage, going up.</p>
<p>It was as if some phantom hand were in control.
Darkness and silence rendered it more
spectral. The ever increasing speed shot terror
to her very heart. Sudden as had been the start,
so sudden was the stop.</p>
<p>Thrown to the floor and all but knocked unconscious,
she slowly struggled to her feet.
What did it mean? What was to be the end
of this terrible adventure?</p>
<p>As she looked before her she saw that the car
had stopped about three feet above some floor.
The doors to that floor were shut. The catches,
however, were within her reach. Should she attempt
to open them and make a leap for it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Had she but known it, those doors were supposed
to open only when the cage was level with
the floor. But the infinite power that tempers
the wind to the shorn lamb sometimes tampers
with man-made doors. As if by magic, the doors
swung back at her touch and with a leap she
was out and away.</p>
<p>Then, gripping her madly beating heart, she
paused to consider. She was free from the elevator,
but where was she? Her situation
seemed more desperate than before. She had
not counted the floors that sped by her. She
did not know whether she was on the sixth or
the tenth floor.</p>
<p>Reason was beginning to come into its own.
With a steadier stride she took a turn about the
place. Putting out a hand, she touched first this
object, then that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furniture,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Now on what
floor is furniture sold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Coming at last to a great overstuffed davenport,
she sat down upon it. Feeling its drowsy
comfort after her hot race, she was half tempted
to stretch herself out upon it, to spread the splendid
cape over her, and thus to spend the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she decided resolutely. &ldquo;Every
extra moment I spend here makes it worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she rose and looked about her. Over
to the right was a broad stretch of pale light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the moonlight falling through the great
skylight of the rotunda,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>Instantly she began making her way in that
direction. Arrived at the railing, she looked
down. She was high up. The very thought of
the dizzy depth below made her feel faint; yet,
fighting against this faintness, she persisted in
looking down until she had established the fact
that she was on the sixth floor. There remained
then but to descend three flights of stairs to find
the blessed third floor and, perhaps, Rennie.</p>
<p>She was not long in descending. Then, such
a silent cry of joy as escaped her lips as she
saw Rennie&rsquo;s light still dimly burning in the far
corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Slipping on the cape, the better to hide the dust
and dirt she had collected from many falls, she
at last tiptoed up close to the desk where Rennie
was working.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, dearie,&rdquo; said Rennie, smiling up at
her through her thick glasses. &ldquo;Ready to go?
In just one moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile caught her breath in astonishment.
Then the truth burst upon her. The whole wild
adventure through which she had been driven at
lightning speed had consumed but half an hour.
So intent upon her work had dear old Rennie
been that she had not noted the passing of time.</p>
<p>Some three minutes later, arm in arm, they
were making their way down the dark and
gloomy marble stairs; and a moment later, having
safely passed the guard, they were out on the
deserted street.</p>
<p>The instant they passed through the door they
were caught in a great whirl of wind and snow
that carried them half the way to State Street
before they could check their mad gait. For
Rennie, who was to take the surface line, this
was well enough; but for Lucile it meant an
additional half block of beating her way back
to her station on the &ldquo;L.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>With a screamed &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; that was
caught up and carried away by the storm, she
tore herself away and, bending low, leaped full
into the teeth of the gale.</p>
<p>A royal battle ensued. The wind, seeming to
redouble its fury at sight of a fresh victim,
roared at her, tore at her, then turning and twisting,
appeared to shake her as some low born
parent shakes his child. Snow cut her face. The
blue cape, wrapping about her more than once,
tripped her for a near fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s warm! Oh, so warm!&rdquo; she breathed.
Then, even in the midst of all this, she asked
herself the meaning of all this strange mystery
of the night, and, of a sudden, the sight of Laurie
stepping into that tortuous chute flashed back
upon the screen of her memory.</p>
<p>Stopping stock still to grasp a post of the elevated&rsquo;s
steel frame, she steadied herself and tried
to think. Should she turn back? Should she
make one more attempt to rescue Laurie from
whatever plight he may have gotten himself into?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>For a moment, swaying like a dead leaf on a
tree, she clung there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
go back there to-night! Not for worlds!&rdquo; She
made one desperate leap across the street and
was the next moment beating her way up the
steel stairway to the elevated.</p>
<p>Once aboard the well heated train, with the
fur lined cape adding its cozy warmth to her
chilled and weary body, she relaxed for the first
time to think in a quiet way of the night&rsquo;s affair.</p>
<p>A careful review of events convinced her that
she had behaved in quite a wild and insane
manner at times, but that on the whole the outcome
was quite satisfactory. Certainly she could
not have been expected to return home without
a wrap on a night such as this. Surely she had
had nothing whatever to do with Laurie&rsquo;s giving
away his pass-out, nor of his flinging himself so
recklessly down the parcel chute. He was almost
a stranger to her. Why, then, should she concern
herself with the outcome of an affair which
he had clearly entered into of his own free will?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>On this last point she could not feel quite comfortable,
but since the elevated train was hurling
her homeward and since she could not, had
she used her utmost will-power, have driven herself
back into that great darkened store, and
since there was no likelihood of her being admitted
without a pass, she concluded that she
must still be moving in the path of destiny.</p>
<p>In strange contrast to the wild whirling storm
outside, she found her room a cozy nook of comfort.
After throwing off her street clothes and
going through a series of wild gymnastics that
came very near to flying, she drew on her dream
robe, threw a dressing gown across her shoulders
then sank into a great overstuffed chair. There,
curled up like a squirrel in a nest of leaves, she
gave herself over to cozy comfort and to
thoughts.</p>
<p>She had arrived at a very comforting one&mdash;which
was that since she had worked until
ten this night she need not report for duty until
twelve the next day&mdash;when a spot of color
caught her eye. A tiny flash of crimson shone
out from a background of midnight blue. The
midnight blue was the rare cape which she had
hung against the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what that touch of scarlet means?&rdquo;
she whispered drowsily. Immediately she
thought of Hawthorne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Scarlet Letter.&rdquo; She
shuddered at the thought. She had dreamed bad
dreams for weeks after reading that book.</p>
<p>Gathering up her robe, she sprang lightly from
the chair to put out a hand and take up the folds
of the cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thread,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;a crimson thread!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the thread had not been accidentally
caught up by the garment she saw at once. With
a needle it had been passed twice through the
cloth, then tied in a loose knot. It was at the
place on the cape that rested over one&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why would one wear such a curious
ornament?&rdquo; she asked herself while a puzzled
look came on her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Scarlet Letter, a crimson thread across
one&rsquo;s heart. How similar! How very strange!&rdquo;
she mused. Again she shuddered. Was this
some ominous omen?</p>
<p>With deft fingers she untied the knot, and
drawing the thread free, carried it to her great
chair where, intent upon examining the thread
in detail, she again curled herself into a position
of perfect comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; she exclaimed after a time. &ldquo;Strange
sort of thread! Looks like ordinary silk thread
at first. About size 40 I&rsquo;d say, but if you examine
it closely you discover a strand of purple
running through it, a very fine strand, but unmistakable,
running from end to end. How very,
very unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she said slowly after another moment&rsquo;s
thought, &ldquo;the whole affair is dark, hidden,
mysterious. And,&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly
leaping from her chair and clasping her hands
in ecstasy, &ldquo;how I do adore a mystery. I&rsquo;ll solve
it, too! See if I don&rsquo;t! And I must! I must!
This cape is not mine. I cannot keep it. It is
my duty to see that it is returned to the owner,
whoever she is and whatever her motive for entering
our store at that unearthly hour and for
leaving her wrap instead of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Drawing a needle from the cushion on her
chifforobe, she threaded it with the crimson bit
with its purple strand, then, after selecting the
spot from which it had been taken, she drew it
through the wonderful cloth twice and knotted
it as it had been before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s done. Now
for bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two thoughts passed across her dreamy mind
before she fell asleep: &ldquo;I may sleep until ten.
How perfectly gorgeous! The first person I
shall look for when I enter the store will be
Laurie Seymour. I wonder if I shall see him?
How exciting. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of this last wonder she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />A NEW MYSTERY</h2>
<p>It was a very satisfactory reflection that Lucile&rsquo;s
mirror returned to her next morning at
ten. After fifteen minutes of such gymnastics
as even a girl can perform in her own room with
the shades down, followed by five minutes of a
cold shower, she stood there pink and glowing
as a child. The glow of health and joy remained
on her cheeks even after her drab working dress
had been drawn on. It was heightened by the
half hiding of them in that matchless white fox
collar. Almost instantly, however, a look of perplexity
overspread her face as her eyes caught
the reflection of a tiny spot of crimson against
the darker color of the gorgeous cape which
had so mysteriously come into her possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crimson thread,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I do
wonder what it could mean.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>The elevated train whirled her swiftly to her
place of toil.</p>
<p>To her vast relief, the first familiar figure
to catch her eyes as she passed between the tables
of books in her own corner at the store was that
of Laurie Seymour.</p>
<p>Could it be that as he smiled and nodded to
her she caught in his eye a look of witching
mockery? One thing she did see plainly enough&mdash;there
were slight bruises and two freshly plastered
cuts on his right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got them when he went down the chute,&rdquo;
she told herself.</p>
<p>As she paused before him she threw back the
broad front of the mysterious cape and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know something about this, I am
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon?&rdquo; He started and Lucile
thought she saw a sudden flush on his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know something about this,&rdquo; she
repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, begging your pardon again,&rdquo; he
answered easily. &ldquo;Having had no sisters and
having never ventured into matrimony, I know
almost nothing about women&rsquo;s garments. I
should say, though, that it was a fine cape, a
corking fine one. You should be proud of it,
really you should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all said in such a serious tone, and
yet with such a concealed touch of mockery in
it, that Lucile abruptly turned away. Plainly
there was nothing to be learned from him concerning
the mystery, at least not at the present
moment.</p>
<p>As she turned, her eyes chanced to fall upon
a stack of books that stood by the end of the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There were
two hundred books in that stack last night! Now
they are at least a third gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Laurie smiled, and in his smile there
was a look of personal interest. &ldquo;Yes, they are
going very well indeed. We shall need to be
ordering more soon. You see, it&rsquo;s the critics.
They say it is a good book, an especially good
book for young folks. I can&rsquo;t say as to that. It
sells, I can assure you of that, and is going to
sell more and more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>As Lucile made her way to the cloak room,
she was reminded of a rumor that had passed
through the department on the previous day.
The rumor had it that Jefrey Farnsworth, the
author of this remarkable book &ldquo;Blue Flames,&rdquo;
(of which she and Laurie had just been speaking,
and which was proving to be a best seller
in its line and threatening to outsell the latest
popular novel) had disappeared shortly after the
publication of his book.</p>
<p>The rumor went on further to dilate upon the
subject to the extent that this promising young
man (for he was a young man&mdash;no rumor
about that) had received a letter the very day
he had vanished. There was no mystery about
the letter. Having been found on his table, it
had proven to be but a letter from his publishers
saying that his book would undoubtedly be a
great success and that, should he be willing to
arrange a lecture to be given before women&rsquo;s
clubs regarding his work and his books, they
had no doubt but that he would greatly profit
by it and that in the end his sales would be
doubled. Women&rsquo;s clubs all over the land would
welcome him with open hands and sizable checks.
The letter had said all this and some few other
things. And upon that day, perhaps the most
eventful day of his life, Farnsworth had vanished
as completely as he might had he grown
wings and flown to the moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only a rumor,&rdquo; Lucile said to herself, &ldquo;but
if it&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s mystery number two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly there flashed through her mind the
puzzling look of unusual interest that she had
noticed on Laurie&rsquo;s face as he spoke of the huge
sales of the book.</p>
<p>With this recollection came a strong suggestion
which she instantly put from her mind.</p>
<p>After hanging the mysterious cape in a secluded
corner, she hunted out her sales-book and
plunged into her work. Even a sales-book of
soiled red leather may be entrusted with a mystery.
This she was to learn soon enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>Such an afternoon as it proved to be! She
had need enough for that robust strength of hers.
Saturday afternoon it was&mdash;two weeks before
Christmas. As the clock struck the noon hour
the great office buildings poured forth people
like a molten stream. Bosses, bookkeepers, stenographers,
sales-managers, office boys, every type
of man, woman and overgrown child flooded the
great stores. Mingling with these were the thousands
upon thousands of school children, teachers,
and parents, all free for an afternoon of
pleasure.</p>
<p>A doubtful sort of pleasure, this. Jostling
elbow to elbow, trampling and being trampled
upon, snatching here, snatching there, taking up
goods and tossing them down in the wrong place,
they fought their way about. The toy department,
candy department, children&rsquo;s book department&mdash;these
were the spots where the great
waves of humanity broke most fiercely. Crowded
between a fat woman with a muff and a slim
man with a grouch, Lucile wrote a sale for a
tired looking little lady with two small children.
In the meantime an important appearing woman
in tight fitting kid gloves was insisting that
Lucile had promised to &ldquo;wait upon&rdquo; her next.
As a matter of fact Lucile had not seen her
until that very moment, and had actually promised
to sell a large book to a small person who
was in a hurry to catch a train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Catch a train!&rdquo; Lucile exclaimed to the
checking girl. &ldquo;There must be a train leaving
every two minutes. They&rsquo;re all catching trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, crowded, pushed and jostled about, answering
a hundred reasonable questions and two hundred
unreasonable ones every hour; smiling
when a smile would come, wondering in a vague
sort of way what it was all about, catching the
chance remark of a customer about &ldquo;Christmas
spirit,&rdquo; Lucile fought her way through the long
day.</p>
<p>Then at last, a half hour before closing time,
there came the lull. Blessed lull! Almost as
abruptly as it had come, the flood ebbed away.
Here and there a little group of people moved
slowly away; and here someone argued over a
long forgotten book or hurried in to snatch up
a book and demand instant attention. But in
the main the flood-tide had spent itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Creeping back into a dark corner and seating
herself upon the floor, Lucile added up her
sales and then returned to assist in straightening
up the tables which had taken on the appearance
of a chip yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People have a wonderful respect for books,&rdquo;
she murmured to Laurie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a lot of respect for the one they buy,&rdquo;
smiled Laurie. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll wreck a half dozen
of them to find a spotless copy for their own
purchasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do that, but just think what a
shock to dear Rollo or Algernon if he should
receive a book with a slightly torn jacket-cover
for a Christmas present!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>would</i> be a shock to his nervous system,&rdquo;
laughed Laurie.</p>
<p>For a time they worked on in silence. Lucile
put all the Century classics in order and filled
the gaps left by the frenzied purchasers. Laurie,
working by her side, held up a book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a title for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She read the title: &ldquo;The Hope for Happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should one hope for it when they may
really have it?&rdquo; Laurie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May one have happiness?&rdquo; Lucile asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely one may! Why if one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile turned to find a customer at her elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you sell me this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customer, a lady, thrust a copy of Pinocchio
into her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll take it with me, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sweet mellowness in the voice.</p>
<p>Without glancing up, Lucile set her nimble
fingers to writing the sale. As she wrote, almost
automatically, she chanced to glance at the customer&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>One&rsquo;s hands may be as distinctive and tell as
much of character as one&rsquo;s face. It was so with
these hands. Lucile had never seen such fingers.
Long, slim, tapering, yet hard and muscular, they
were such fingers as might belong to a musician
or a pickpocket. Lucile felt she would always
remember those hands as easily as she might
recall the face of some other person. As if to
make doubly sure that she might not forget, on
the forefinger of the right hand was a ring of
cunning and marvelous design; a dragon
wrought in gold, with eyes of diamonds and a
tongue of ten tiny rubies. No American craftsmanship,
this, but Oriental, Indian or Japanese.</p>
<p>Without lifting her eyes, Lucile received the
money, carried her book to the wrapper and delivered
the package to the purchaser. Then she
returned to her task of putting things to rights.</p>
<p>Scarcely a moment had elapsed when, on glancing
toward her cash book which lay open on a
pile of books, she started in surprise.</p>
<p>There could be no mistaking it. From it there
came a flash of crimson. Imagine her surprise
when she found that the top page of her book
had been twice pierced by a needle and that a
crimson thread had been drawn through and
knotted there in exactly the same manner as had
that other bit of thread on the blue cape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>It required but a glance to assure her that
through this thread there ran the single strand
of purple. The next instant she was dashing
down the aisle, hoping against hope that she
might catch a glimpse of the mystery woman
with the extraordinary fingers and the strange
ring.</p>
<p>In this she failed. The woman had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; she exclaimed in exasperation,
&ldquo;to think that I did not look at her face! Such
a foolish way as we do get into&mdash;paying no
attention to our customers! If I had but looked
at her face I would have known. Then I would
have demanded the truth. I would have&mdash;&rdquo;
she paused to reflect, &ldquo;well, perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t
have said so much to her, but I would have known
her better. And now she is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was yet work to be done. Drawing
herself together with an effort, she hurried
back to her table where the disorderly pile of
books lay waiting to be rearranged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of happiness,&rdquo; said Laurie, for all
the world as if their conversation had not been
interrupted, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see much use of writing
a book on the hope for happiness when one may
be happy right here and now. Oh, I know there
are those who sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;This world&rsquo;s a wilderness of woe.</p>
<p class="t0">This world is not my home.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s religion, of a sort; mighty poor
sort, too, I&rsquo;d say. Idea being that this world&rsquo;s
all wrong and that if you enjoy any of it, if the
scent of spring blossoms, the songs of birds, the
laugh of children at play, the lazy drift of fleecy
clouds against the azure sky, if these things make
you happy, then you&rsquo;re all wrong. I guess they&rsquo;d
say: &lsquo;Life here is to be endured. Happiness
only comes after death.&rsquo; Huh! I don&rsquo;t think
much of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can one secure happiness?&rdquo; Lucile
asked the question almost wistfully. She was
over-tired and not a little perplexed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of things that go with making
people happy,&rdquo; said Laurie as his nimble
fingers flew from book to book. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure
that happiness does not come from long hours
in a ball-room nor from smoking cigarettes, nor
any one of the many things that put dark rings
about the eyes of our young new rich or near
rich, and that set their eyelids twitching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happiness,&rdquo; he mused, throwing back his
head and laughing softly. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s as easy
to be happy as it is to tell the truth. Have
friends and be true to them. Find a place you
love to be and be there. Keep your body and
mind fit. Sleep eight hours; eat slowly; take
two hours for quiet thinking every day. Have
a crowd you love, a crowd you feel that you belong
to and fit in with. Of course they&rsquo;ll not
be perfect. None of us are. But loveable they
are, all the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, take the crowd here,&rdquo; he said,
lowering his voice. &ldquo;You and I are transients
here. Christmas eve comes and out we go. But
look at Donnie and Rennie, Bob, Bettie, and dear
old Morrison over there in the corner. They&rsquo;re
the regular ones, been here for years, all of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he continued earnestly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
that when you came in here you had the popular
magazine notion of the people who work in
department stores; slang of the worst kind, paint
an inch thick, lip stick, sordid jealousy, envy, no
love, no fellowship. But look! What would
happen if Rennie, the dear mother and straw-boss
of us all, should slip before a car and be
seriously injured to-night? What would happen?
Not a soul of us all, even us transients,
but would dig down and give our last penny to
buy the things that would help her bear it. That&rsquo;s
what I mean, a gang that you belong to, that you
suffer with, endure things with and enjoy life
with! That&rsquo;s the big secret of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Lucile listened to this short lecture on happiness,
she worked. At last her task was done.
Then with a hurried: &ldquo;Thanks awfully. Goodnight,&rdquo;
she rushed for the cloak-room preparatory
to donning the fur-lined cape. She half
expected to find it gone, but it was not, and after
throwing it across her shoulders she dashed
down the stairs to join the homeward rushing
throng.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>As she snuggled down beneath the covers that
night, she found her mind dwelling with unusually
intense interest upon the events of the past
two days. Like pictures on a screen, strange,
unanswerable questions passed through her
mind. Who was the mystery woman of the night
shadows in the book department? Why had
Laurie given her his pass-out? Why had she
left her gorgeously beautiful cape behind for a
shop girl to wear home? How had the unusual
crimson thread come to be drawn into the cloth
of the cape? Had the mystery woman put it
there? Had she drawn that thread through
the page of Lucile&rsquo;s cash book? It seemed that
she must have. But why? Why? Why? This
last word kept ringing in her ears. Why had
Laurie given up his pass-out? Where had he
slept that night? How did it happen that an
elevator in a department store at night ran of
its own accord with no one to work the lever?
Surely here were problems enough to keep one
small brain busy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Then again, there was the problem of the
missing author of that wonderfully successful
book. What did Laurie know about that? Why
had he talked so strangely about it?</p>
<p>When she had allowed all these problems to
pass in review before her mind&rsquo;s eye, she came
to but one conclusion&mdash;that she would believe
Laurie a sincere and trustworthy person until he
had been proven otherwise. Her faith had been
shaken a bit by the revelation of the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she whispered sleepily to herself, &ldquo;is
certainly strange. Surely one who can talk so
wonderfully about happiness can&rsquo;t be bad. And
yet it&rsquo;s all very mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right there she concluded that mysteries of
the right sort added much to the happiness of
us all, and with that she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />THE PICTURE GIRL</h2>
<p>Little dreaming of the stirring events that
awaited her, and without the slightest anticipation
of the new mystery and unusual responsibilities
that were crowding in upon her that day,
Lucile took her Monday morning train with the
quiet composure of one who, having enjoyed a
perfect Sunday of rest, looks forward with
enthusiasm to a day of interesting service.</p>
<p>The supreme moment of that day arrived in
a rather unusual place at a time when the clock&rsquo;s
hands were nearing the hour of 1:00. Before
that, however, there came hours of the usual toil
which many would call drudgery. From eight-thirty
until ten there were few customers. Every
moment was taken up. Two truckloads of books
had come down from the apparently inexhaustable
storerooms above. These must be placed on
the tables. Tables must be dusted; cash-books
filled with blanks for the day; books out of place
must be returned to the proper section.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>As Lucile came and went in the performance
of her allotted tasks, she was more and more
impressed with what Laurie had said about this
group of loyal friends, this company of sales-people
who were so much like a very large
family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all my friends, almost my kinsfolk,&rdquo;
she told herself with a little gulp of joy
that was very near to tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>And so they were. Even outside her little
corner they greeted her with a comradely smile.
There was the pleasing lady who sold new
fiction, and the tumbled haired lady who sold
travel books and had sold books in stores from
coast to coast. In the first alcove was the
worried lady who handled standard sets; in the
second was the dignified one who murmured in
low, church-like tones of prayer books and
rosaries; while in the farthest, deepest alcove
of all was dear old Morrison, the young-old man
with premature gray hair and a stoop. But his
lustrous eyes were lighted with an earnestness
such as one seldom looks into, and he had an
air of poise and refinement and a smile of
perfect fellowship. He sold fine bindings, and
knew them well. Besides that, he could tell you
the name and publishers of every book for
serious minded people published since the days
of Ben Franklin.</p>
<p>Working among such people as these, and in
spite of all her strenuous hours of labor, Lucile
dreaded the coming of Christmas Eve when she
must bid them all farewell and return to her
studies. Never before had she been so tempted
to relinquish her cherished hope of university
training and to settle down to work among a
host of interesting and loyal friends.</p>
<p>So the forenoon wore away, and with the
passing of each hour the great and startling
event of that day came sixty minutes nearer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The noon hour at last arrived. Having hastily
eaten her paper-bag lunch, Lucile hurried from
the store. There was yet three-quarters of an
hour to spend. She would spend the time sauntering
through a place of great enchantment, the
Art Museum.</p>
<p>Five minutes of battling with wind and intense
cold, and she was there. Racing up the stone
steps, she paused an instant for breath. Then
she entered and hurried up the broad marble
stairway. At last she came to a place where
a great circular leather cushioned seat in the
center of a room offered opportunity for perfect
repose. There she sank down, to hide her eyes
with her hands until the frost and the glare of
snow had left them, then to open them slowly
and to squint away contentedly toward the wall
which lay before her.</p>
<p>Before her, and a little to the left, was a
painting from Ireland, the work of a great
master. It was a simple thing in a way, a boy
clad in humble garb shoveling snow, and a girl
with a shawl thrown over her shoulders, coming
down the well cleaned path. Very simple people
these, but happy and kind. There were sparrows
perched along the path. A very humble theme,
but such masses of wonderful color! Had she
not seen it, Lucile would not have believed that
artists could have achieved such perfection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>To the left was an equally lovely picture;
dawn on the heather, the sun rising from the
dripping dewy green and a girl reaper going to
her toil with the song of a lark on her lips and
joy in her eye.</p>
<p>These were the pictures that brought rest and
joy to Lucile&rsquo;s half hour of leisure and helped
prepare her for events that cast no shadow
before them.</p>
<p>She had descended the marble stairs and was
about to leave the building when a picture
arrested her attention; a living picture of a girl.
And such a girl as she was! A supple grace to
her waist and shoulders, a proper curve at the
ankles, and a face&mdash;such a face! Cheeks aglow
with the color the frosty out-of-doors had given
them. Cheeks offset by dark, deep-set eyes,
made darker still by eyelashes that were like
hemlocks in a snow covered valley, and a smooth
oval forehead backed by a wealth of short, wavy
hair. This was the picture; only faintly sketched,
for behind all this beauty there was a certain
strength of character, a force of will that seemed
a slumbering fire gleaming from her eyes. In
the background were people and marble pillars.
The girl had just entered the Museum and,
uncertain of her way, stood irresolute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s from the country,&rdquo; Lucile whispered
to herself. &ldquo;Her clothes show that. But how
startling, how unusual, how&mdash;how striking
she is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like the pictures I&rsquo;ve been seeing, they
were unusual and priceless. She is the same.
And yet,&rdquo; a feeling of fear and sadness swept
over her, &ldquo;those priceless pictures are carefully
guarded night and day. I wonder if she is? She
seems alone. It&rsquo;s not to be wondered at, their
guarding those pictures. Who would not like
one for his room? Who would not love to open
his eyes each morning upon the girl in the
&lsquo;Song of the Lark&rsquo;? But they&rsquo;d wish to
possess that girl, too. A father, a mother, sister,
brother, would be proud to possess her, to look
at her every morning, a&mdash;anyone would. And
yet, she&rsquo;s not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Her meditations were cut short by sight of
a figure standing not ten feet from her; a tall,
slim, young man whose features might have been
carved from marble, and in whose eyes Lucile
had surprised a steely glance such as she had
once caught in the beady eye of a down-swooping
hawk.</p>
<p>And then, as if enacting her part in a play,
the girl of this living picture suddenly wavered
where she stood. Her face went white, then
with a little, wavering cry, she crumpled in a
heap on the marble floor.</p>
<p>Lucile could have sworn the girl was alone
and uncertain of her next move. She understood
what had happened. Having traveled far
in the intense cold, the girl had been overcome
by the heavy warmth of the museum and had
fainted. The thing that happened next puzzled
Lucile beyond belief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>After ten seconds of motionless panic, a half
score of people sprang to her assistance. But
the young man, he of the marble features and
steely eye, was first up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he was saying in a quiet, even
tone, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s my sister. I&rsquo;ll take care of her. We
have a car outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lifting the unconscious girl in his arms, he
started for the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not all right! It&rsquo;s not all right!&rdquo; Lucile
fairly shrieked the words.</p>
<p>To her vast astonishment, the next moment
she was gripping a burly guard by the arm and
saying in a voice hoarse with emotion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not all right! He&rsquo;s not her brother.
He&mdash;he&rsquo;s stealing her! Stop them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her further astonishment, the guard
believed her. With three strides he reached the
door and blocked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here!&rdquo; he said in the tone of one
who is accustomed to be obeyed. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do.
You can&rsquo;t take her out like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; there was a note of forced
indifference in the young man&rsquo;s voice, but there
was murder in his cold, hard eyes. &ldquo;All right,
if you know so much. Fetch some water and
get her out of it. She&rsquo;ll tell you I&rsquo;m her brother.
But be quick about it. You&rsquo;re a beef-head for
ordering a gentleman about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile&rsquo;s heart went to the bottom of her
shoes. What was this? Had her emotions led
her astray? Was he indeed the girl&rsquo;s brother?
It would seem so, else why would he consent so
readily to the delay, which must mean proof one
way or another? She was soon to see. Tremblingly,
she awaited the outcome. Dropping
upon the marble floor, she pillowed the girl&rsquo;s head
in her lap and brushing away the hair from the
face, caressed the cold forehead with a soft
hand.</p>
<p>When the water had been brought Lucile
dampened her handkerchief and laid it icy cold
on the other&rsquo;s forehead. Almost instantly the
eyes opened and the girl, having dragged herself
to a sitting position, stared about the museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where am I?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What
has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the Art Museum. You fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Faint&mdash;fainted!&rdquo; There was terror in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the cold. It&rsquo;s nothing, really nothing.&rdquo;
Lucile put a steadying arm about her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be quite all right in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where is that brother of hers?&rdquo; grumbled
the guard. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s nowhere to be seen! He&rsquo;s
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; echoed Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother?&rdquo; said the girl in astonishment. &ldquo;I
have no brother. I am alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a wave of feeling swept over Lucile as
made her sick and faint. She had been right,
dreadfully right. She had saved this girl, this
wonderful creature, from&mdash;she dared not think
from what.</p>
<p>For a moment, rocked by her emotions, she
sat there in silence. At last, with a supreme
effort, she dragged herself to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look the worst of the two,&rdquo; said the
guard, giving her a keen glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; she protested stoutly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>To the girl, whom she had assisted to her
feet, she said, &ldquo;You may come with me if you
wish. Our store&rsquo;s only two blocks away. There&rsquo;s
a rest room. You&rsquo;ll be all right there until you
sort of get your bearings. Perhaps I can help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d be glad to,&rdquo; said the other, clinging
to her impulsively.</p>
<p>So they left the museum together. Though
she kept a sharp watch to right and left, Lucile
caught no sign of the volunteer brother, but she
shivered once or twice at the very thought of
him.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>It was a very much perplexed Lucile who
curled up in her big chair that night for a few
moments of quiet thought before retiring.</p>
<p>A new mystery had been added to her already
well filled list of strange doings. &ldquo;First,&rdquo; she
said to herself, telling them off like beads on a
rosary, &ldquo;there comes the beautiful mystery
woman and the cape she left behind; then Laurie
Seymour and the vanishing author; then the
crimson thread; and now this girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>As she whispered this last she nodded toward
the bed. There, lying wrapped in slumber, was
the beautiful girl she had saved in the museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s even more beautiful in sleep than
when awake,&rdquo; Lucile murmured. &ldquo;And such a
strange creature! She hasn&rsquo;t told me a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last statement was entirely true. Any
notion Lucile had of the girl, any guess at her
hidden secrets, was based on observation and
conjecture alone. Not one word regarding them
had escaped the strange girl&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>Having accompanied Lucile to the store, she
had lain upon a couch in the &ldquo;quiet room&rdquo; for
three hours. Whenever Lucile had stolen a
moment from work to look in upon her, the girl
had appeared to be day-dreaming. Far from
being worried about events of the past or the
immediate future, she had appeared to be enjoying
the recalling of an interesting adventure
or anticipating one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>At five she had risen from the cot and, having
brushed her hair and arranged her clothing, had
insisted upon helping her new-found friend to
put her tables to rights. She had accepted
Lucile&rsquo;s invitation to pass the night with her
with the nonchalance of one who is offered this
courtesy from a long-time friend.</p>
<p>Innocent of one scrap of baggage, in the same
manner she had accepted Lucile&rsquo;s offer of a
dream robe.</p>
<p>In only one respect had she showed her independence.
Having produced a dollar bill from
somewhere on her person, she had insisted on
paying for her own frugal lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her clothes are the strangest of all,&rdquo; Lucile
whispered to herself. &ldquo;When a girl comes upon
a run of hard luck, she&rsquo;s likely to try to keep up
an appearance even though she is shabby underneath.
But look at her; a countrified suit of
shiny blue serge, two years behind the times,
and her undergarments are new and of the finest
silk, up to the minute, too. How is one to explain
that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>She was not disturbed in the least about the
girl&rsquo;s morals. She was as sweet and clean as
a fresh blooming rose. Lucile would have sworn
to that. With the lights turned out, and with
the tingling winter air entering the open window,
before retiring the girl had joined Lucile in the
nightly &ldquo;setting up&rdquo; exercises and had appeared
to enjoy them, too.</p>
<p>The strange girl&rsquo;s skin was like the finest satin.
Her lines were perfect, her muscles superb.
Through lack of knowledge of the exercises,
she often blundered. But she could whirl more
quickly, leap higher and swing about more gracefully
than Lucile, who had never failed to throw
her whole heart into her gym work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that,&rdquo; Lucile murmured as she drew off
her bathrobe preparatory to slipping beneath the
covers, &ldquo;all that, and she has not told me one
word about herself. For a country girl she
certainly has her full supply of reserve.
To-morrow I am to try to get work for her as a
wrapper. No doubt I can do it. And then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>She thought about the future for a moment.
She was alone this year. If you have read our
book, &ldquo;The Cruise of the O&rsquo;Moo,&rdquo; you will
remember that while living in the yacht in dry
dock she had two companions&mdash;Florence and
Marion. Florence had gone home. Marion was
in Alaska. Now Lucile was alone. She would
welcome a friend and, unless she had misread
her character, this girl had the qualities of a
steadfast and loyal pal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her past?&rdquo; Lucile whispered as she
placed her slippers beneath the bed and drew
back the covers. &ldquo;Ah well, we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once during the night she was wakened by
the girl, who was evidently talking in her sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them. Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she all but
screamed as she threw out her arms for protection
from some dream foe.</p>
<p>Putting her arms about her, Lucile held her
tight until the dream had passed and she fell
back once more into peaceful slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />&ldquo;COME AND FIND ME&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pull some wires.&rdquo; The kindly face of
Morrison, the man of fine bindings, gleamed as
he said these words to Lucile next morning.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way things are done these days.
I haven&rsquo;t much notion how they were done in
the past. But now, if I want anything, I pull
some wires. For instance, your young friend
whom you found in the Art Museum and whose
name is Cordelia but whom you choose to call
Cordie for short, wants work in this store. You
ask me to pull wires and I pull &rsquo;em. I pull one
and Miss So and So comes bowing out of her
box of an office and I whisper what I want. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
pull some wires,&rsquo; says she, putting on her best
smile. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put in a wedge, a very thin wedge.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She puts in her thin wedge. She pulls some
wires and Mr. So and So up on the eleventh
floor bobs bowing out of his box and inclines
his ear to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! Yes, I see, I see,&rsquo; he murmurs. &lsquo;I shall
pull some wires.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pulls some wires. A slip of paper
appears. It is signed. It is given to your friend.
She goes here, she bobs there, and presently here
she is. She has accepted &lsquo;the iron ring,&rsquo; wrapping
packages with very gay company all about
her, having a good time and getting pay for it.
But let me assure you it could not be done
without wires pulled and thin wedges inserted.
No, it could not be done. Nothing these days
is done without wires and wedges. Wires and
wedges, wedges and wires, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this very lucid explanation of the way
the world is run these days, the benevolent
Morrison bowed himself away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>True to his prediction, two hours later the
mysteriously silent Cordelia was installed in an
obscure corner of the book section, working at
the wrapping counter. She had accepted &ldquo;the
iron ring,&rdquo; said ring being an affair of solid
iron into which, in a semi-circular bump on its
edge, had been set a sharp bit of steel. The
theory is that the steel edge cuts the stout cord
with which the bundles are tied. Truth was that
more often the sharp edge cut the girls&rsquo; fingers
than did the steel the string. So, in time having
learned wisdom, Cordie discarded this doubtful
bit of jewelry and used a knife. However, she
worked on steadily and quite skillfully. Before
night it had become evident to all that the girl
was proving a credit to her young protector, and
that, take it all in all, wires had not been pulled
nor wedges inserted in vain.</p>
<p>Two matters of interest came to Lucile&rsquo;s
attention that day. A rumor was confirmed and
a discovery made that in the end was to take
someone somewhere.</p>
<p>First in regard to the discovery. Someone
had left a morning paper on Lucile&rsquo;s table of
books. She snatched it up and was about to
consign it to the waste box when a headline
caught her eye:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;COME AND FIND ME&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Beneath this was a second headline:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Two Hundred Dollars for a Handshake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not time to read what followed.
Hastily tearing the corner from the page, she
thrust this scrap into her pocket to be read later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rumor&rsquo;s confirmed,&rdquo; said Laurie a
moment later as he thrust a clipping from a publisher&rsquo;s
weekly in her hand.</p>
<p>There were but a few lines. Lucile read them
in a moment. It had to do with the disappearance
of the promising young writer, Jefrey
Farnsworth, author of &ldquo;Blue Flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no doubt,&rdquo; the article went on
to say, &ldquo;that the young man has utterly disappeared.
Being a single man with few intimates,
and a man who lived a rather secluded life, he
has either slipped away without being noticed
or has met with some grave mishap. His publishers
are greatly disturbed over his disappearance.
Without doubting his willingness to assist
in the task of being made famous, they had
booked him for talks before no less than twenty
women&rsquo;s clubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As the popularity of his book, &lsquo;Blue Flames,&rsquo;
had grown by leaps and bounds, every woman
in the country was ready to be told by him just
what her son or daughter should or should not
read. There was not the least doubt but that
here was the first genuine best seller in the line
since the first days of Treasure Island and
Huckleberry Finn. Yes, the world was ready to
hear him speak. But Farnsworth was not
ready&mdash;at least he has vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty women&rsquo;s clubs,&rdquo; exclaimed Laurie,
doing a feint in pantomime. &ldquo;Think of
speaking to twenty women&rsquo;s clubs! Thousands
and thousands of kid-gloved, well fed, contented
women! Oh! Wow! Twenty clubs, then twenty
more and twenty after that! To drink tea with
&rsquo;em and to have them grip your hand and tell
you how they enjoyed the rot you fed to them!
Oh! Ow! Ow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s clubs are all right,&rdquo; protested
Lucile, her face lighting with anger. &ldquo;Their
work is constructive. They do a great deal of
good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beg a thousand pardons,&rdquo; said Laurie, coloring
in his turn. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to say they
weren&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re all right, and the ladies too,
Lord bless &rsquo;em. But how does that go to prove
that a poor, innocent young writer, who happens
to have struck gold with his pen but who never
made a speech in his life, should be chained to
a platform and made to do tricks like a trained
bear before thousands of women? Women&rsquo;s
clubs are all right, but they couldn&rsquo;t club me to
death with their clubs.&rdquo; He threw back his
shoulders to join Lucile in a laugh over his rather
bad pun, and there, for the time being the matter
ended.</p>
<p>Lucile was destined to recall the whole affair
from time to time. Hours later, she had an
opportunity to study his face unobserved. She
noted his high forehead, his even and rugged
features, his expressive hands, and when she
saw him selling away on that stock of &ldquo;Blue
Flames&rdquo; as if his life depended upon it, she was
led to wonder a great wonder. However, she
kept this wonder to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The noon hour had come before Lucile found
time to again look at the scrap of printing she
had torn from the discarded newspaper. In the
employees&rsquo; lunch room, over a glass of milk and
a sandwich, and with the wonderful Cordie
sitting opposite, she read the thing through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and find me. I am the Spirit of
Christmas,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;I offer gold, two hundred
in gold, for a shake of the hand, yet no one
is so kind as to give me the clasp of cheer. I am
the Spirit of Christmas. I am tall and slim,
and of course I am a woman&mdash;a young woman
whom some have been so kind as to call fair.
To-day I dress in the garb of a working woman.
Yesterday it was the coat of a sales-girl. At
another time it was in more gorgeous apparel.
But always my face and my hands are the same.
Ah yes, my hands! There is as much to be
learned from the hands as from the face. Character
and many secrets are written there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I walked the Boulevard, as I
promised I should, yet not one of the rushing
thousands paused to shake my hand and say:
&lsquo;You are the Spirit of Christmas.&rsquo; Had one
done so, tho&rsquo; he had been but a beggar in rags,
the two hundred of gold would have clinked into
his pocket. Yet not one paused. They all
passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I entered a little shop to purchase a tiny bit
of candy. The saleslady, a little black-eyed
creature, scowled at me and refused to sell so
little, even though I looked to be a shop-girl.
She did not shake my hand, and I was glad,
for had she done so and had she said: &lsquo;You are
the Spirit of Christmas,&rsquo; the gold would have
clinked for her. I left my mark, which is my
sign, and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later I entered a busy shop, a great shop
where tired girls rushed here and there constantly.
I troubled a dear little girl who had a
wan smile and tender eyes, to show me many
things. I bought nothing in the end, but she was
kind and courteous for all that. I wished&mdash;Oh,
how I wished that she would grasp my hand
and whisper ever so softly: &lsquo;You are the Spirit
of Christmas.&rsquo; But she said never a word, so
the gold did not clink for her. After leaving
my mark, which is also my sign, I passed on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To-day I shall join the throngs that shop
among the windows of State Street. I shall
enter a store here and another there. I shall
pause here to examine goods and there to make
a purchase. At every place, as I pass on, I shall
leave my mark, which is also my sign. If you
chance to see me, if you know me, if you read
my secret in my face or in my hands, grasp
those hands and whisper: &lsquo;You are the Spirit
of Christmas.&rsquo; Then gold will clink for you, two
hundred in gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Spirit of Christmas. Everywhere
I go I leave a crimson trail behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the end. Lucile glanced up with a
dazed and puzzled look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world can it mean?&rdquo; she asked,
holding the bit of paper before Cordie.</p>
<p>Cordie laughed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something the paper
is doing. I think it&rsquo;s just to make people buy
the paper. No one has ever recognized her.
She&rsquo;s clever.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find her,&rdquo; mused Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you, though? Who wouldn&rsquo;t?
You&rsquo;d get the gold if you did; but you never
will. She&rsquo;s keen. Why, only two days ago she
was in this store for a half hour. Bought a
book, mind you, and you may have sold it to her.
Think of that! The day before that she was in
the store for six hours. Think of that! And no
one knew her. They&rsquo;ll never get her, trust her
for that. But if they do, the gold will clink.&rdquo;
The girl laughed a merry laugh, then hurried
away for a cream-puff.</p>
<p>Left to herself, Lucile had time for a few
moments of quiet thinking. She found her pulse
strangely quickened by the news story and her
companion&rsquo;s interpretation. Somehow, almost as
if some strange power outside her were whispering
it to her, she felt forced to believe that she
could connect this new and interesting discovery
with some of the other mysteries which had come
to haunt her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Cordie appeared to know a great deal about
this &ldquo;Spirit of Christmas&rdquo; lady and the gold
that would clink for a handshake. But after all,
she had revealed no facts that were not known
to hundreds of thousands who had followed the
matter closely. It had all been in the papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t tell me anything about Cordie,&rdquo;
Lucile whispered, &ldquo;except&mdash;&rdquo; she paused suddenly.
Cordie had told of things that had
happened in the city four days back. Could she
have been in the city all this time? Probably had
been. And without baggage, or so much as a
dream-robe. How very strange!</p>
<p>But had she been without baggage? Might
she not owe a board bill? Might not her belongings
be in the hands of some landlady at the
present time?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder she doesn&rsquo;t tell me about herself,&rdquo;
Lucile murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to ask her.
A person who is forced to reveal her past is
almost sure to tell anything but the truth. I must
wait her time. It&rsquo;s true she has a little money;
but perhaps not enough to pay the bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she went on thoughtfully, &ldquo;why
I don&rsquo;t cut her adrift? Why should I be looking
after her? Haven&rsquo;t I enough to do in looking
after myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that she had her own responsibilities,
but she knew right well that if need be she
would do a great deal more for the girl before
casting her off to become an easy prey to the
human hawks and vultures who haunt a great
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this lady of the Christmas Spirit,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;The good fates surely know I need
that gold. And if this strange little beauty,
Cordie, costs me something, which she promises
to do, I shall need it more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more her eyes ran over the scrap of
paper. They came to a sudden pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind me I leave a crimson trail,&rdquo; she read.</p>
<p>For a moment her brow was wrinkled in
puzzled thought. Then she gave a sudden start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it should be! If it meant just that!&rdquo; she
exclaimed half aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, of course it couldn&rsquo;t. A crimson
trail&mdash;a crimson trail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one for you,&rdquo; exclaimed Cordie, setting
a delicious cream-puff before her. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
just time for devouring them before we go back
to work. Work! Oh, boy! I say it&rsquo;s work! But
it&rsquo;s heaps of fun, anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;Do you
know James?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is James?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who carries away the packages
from my desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stooped old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not. Take a look at him. He&rsquo;s a sight
for tired eyes. He&mdash;he&rsquo;s intriguing. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
working on him. He&rsquo;s awful reserved, but I
think he likes me. He&rsquo;s got a story. I&rsquo;ll get it.
Leave that to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So even little Cordie loves mysteries and has
found one to study out,&rdquo; thought Lucile with an
amused smile as she turned to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />THE IRON RING</h2>
<p>Cordie&rsquo;s description of James proved quite
true. An intriguing figure was this James; a
stalwart man of forty, a straight, square-shouldered
six-footer, with face as brown as a
coffee bean. He was unmistakably American,
yet he seemed oddly out of place as, with arms
piled high with bundles, he moved steadily
through the crowd. There was a certain directness,
and with all that a slight roll about his
walk, that suggested some sort of sea craft. He
was not unlike some port-to-port steamer, waiting
at dock for its load, then steaming away to
the port of discharge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A silent man, and one who has been accustomed
to command, not to plod,&rdquo; was Lucile&rsquo;s
mental comment. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not accustomed to
being called James, like a chauffeur or a butler.
You can see that by the twinkle in the corner
of his eye when someone calls him by that name.
I wonder what could have brought him to the
extremity of carrying bundles for twenty dollars
a week. I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t drink to excess. His
face would show it if he did. Oh well, that&rsquo;s
Cordie&rsquo;s little mystery. Let her fathom it when
the opportunity comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordie&rsquo;s opportunity came a little later, and
in a decidedly startling manner.</p>
<p>In the meantime this was another busy afternoon;
one of the busiest of the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only listen to them!&rdquo; Lucile said to Cordie
as she waited for a parcel. &ldquo;Most of them are
women trying to select books for boys and girls.
Not one in ten really knows what she wants or
what boys and girls read these days. Listen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Cordie listened as she worked, and this, from a
score of pairs of lips, is what she heard: &ldquo;Have
you got the Alger books?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you keep Peck&rsquo;s
Bad Boy? That&rsquo;s such a splendid story. Don&rsquo;t
you think so?&rdquo; &ldquo;I want a&mdash;a book for a boy
fourteen years old. What can you recommend?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Have you the Elsie books? Those are <i>such</i>
sweet stories!&rdquo; &ldquo;I want a book for a boy twelve
years old. I don&rsquo;t want anything trashy, though.
Which of these fifty-cent books would you recommend?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is this a good book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer,&rdquo; whispered Lucile with a little
giggle, &ldquo;the answer, if they say &lsquo;Is this a good
book?&rsquo; is always &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Always yes, whether
you think so or not. I&rsquo;ll tell you why. Nine
times out of ten, when a woman customer says
&lsquo;Is this a good book?&rsquo; she has already made up
her mind that it is a good book. If you say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;
she&rsquo;ll smile and buy it. If you say &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll
frown and buy it anyway. So why provoke a
frown, and Christmas only two weeks away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only her untiring good nature and her native
sense of humor, kept Lucile on her feet and
going. There were times, however, when even
these deserted her. One of those unfortunate
moments arrived this very afternoon. A particularly
unpleasant customer had said to her:
&ldquo;I want a book about a boy who was brought
up by the monks.&rdquo; After suggesting everything
that seemed akin to this, she happened upon
&ldquo;Tarzan.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the customer,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Tarzan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>A second customer wanted &ldquo;Laddie.&rdquo; When
the modern &ldquo;Laddie&rdquo; was produced, the customer
insisted that this was not the original
&ldquo;Laddie,&rdquo; but a cheap substitute; that the first
&ldquo;Laddie&rdquo; was written years ago by a person
who&rsquo;s name she did not recall, but who had
written another book called something else. She
had insisted on Lucile&rsquo;s asking everyone in the
section about it and, after leaving very warm
and unhappy, reappeared ten minutes later with
another clerk, still looking for the original
&ldquo;Laddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of all this Lucile came upon a
fidgeting customer whose fingers were constantly
plaiting stray locks of hair and whose lips were
saying: &ldquo;I must make a train. I really must.
Do you think you could get them to hurry. Do
you? Do you really? That would be so nice
of you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>After hurrying the sale through and getting
many a sharp look for stepping in ahead of her
turn, Lucile had the pleasure of seeing the customer
meet a friend an aisle over and pause for
a prolonged spell of gossip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could believe that they could be such
children?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t the
Broncho Buster Boys,&rdquo; she turned to answer a
query. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fifty-cent series which we do
not carry.&rdquo; The person who asked the question
was a rather pompous lady in kid gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the Broncho Buster Boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught the words spoken behind her back.
The customer, ignoring her decided negative, had
deliberately turned about and asked the same
question of a girl who had come on the floor that
morning and knew nothing about the stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her,&rdquo; Lucile said in as steady a tone
as she could command, &ldquo;that we do not carry
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the customer flew into a towering
rage. Her words, though quite proper on the lips
of a society lady, were the sort that cut to the
very soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>A sharp retort came to Lucile&rsquo;s lips and she
said it.</p>
<p>She was in the midst of it when a hand touched
her shoulder and a steady voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words, while not said in an unkindly tone,
had a ring of authority to them. Wheeling about,
Lucile found herself facing a beautiful lady, one
of the most beautiful she had ever seen; black
hair, full cheeks of wonderful color, and eyes of
the deepest blue. Lucile took in all the beauty
of her for the first time at a glance, and at the
same moment cold terror struck to her heart.
This was Miss Bruce, the head of the section, the
one who could dismiss a salesgirl at a word.
And she had just heard Lucile break the most
rigid rule of the house! She had talked back to
a customer!</p>
<p>White faced, staring, endeavoring to speak but
uttering no sound, Lucile stood there as if frozen
to the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, dearie! I know how it is.
Don&rsquo;t do it again, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Lucile felt a
friendly pressure on her arm, then the great lady
of the section was gone.</p>
<p>In spite of her bravest efforts, tears rushed to
Lucile&rsquo;s eyes. One splashed down on either
cheek before she could check them. Were they
tears of vexation or gratitude, or merely tired
tears? Who could say?</p>
<p>Through the tears Lucile dimly saw a face. It
was an electrifying vision, and dashing away
the tears, she became at once her own, keen,
better self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, it is! It&rsquo;s the Mystery Lady,&rdquo; she
assured herself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s talking to Cordie.
I must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she started toward the wrapping stand
where stood the Mystery Lady, a voice at her
elbow said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you sell me this? Could you have them
hurry a little? I must make a train. I really
must.&rdquo; It was the harried and hurried lady of
a half hour previous. She had found another
book and was making another train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>With great reluctance and much pent-up
anger, Lucile waited upon her; and in the meantime,
as was her wont, the Mystery Lady, the
lady of the crimson thread, had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who was the tall lady you were
speaking to a moment ago?&rdquo; she breathlessly
asked Cordie a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? She asked me for a
string to tie a package. Lots of them ask for
string, or a piece of corrugated paper, or a card
to write a greeting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was about all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile. &ldquo;Who put that
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was pointing to a loose end of wrapping
paper through which had been drawn and neatly
tied a bit of crimson thread with a single purple
strand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; smiled Cordie. &ldquo;How should I
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Lucile was disengaging the thread and
thrusting it in her pocket, Cordie was searching
the top of her desk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;It was
here a moment ago. Now it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My iron ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you cut cord with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to use it for that,&rdquo; Cordie
tossed her head. &ldquo;The thing cuts my finger. All
the same, I ought to have it. You&rsquo;re supposed to
turn such things in when they lay you off. But
if it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; Shrugging her shoulders,
she promptly forgot it. So did Lucile, but
the time came when she was reminded of the loss
in a most forceful manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she whispered as she moved
away, &ldquo;I do wonder what she does that for. This
is the third time. It&rsquo;s the strangest thing I ever
heard of.&rdquo; She fingered the crimson thread.</p>
<p>The melting away of great stocks of the year&rsquo;s
most popular book for young people, &ldquo;Blue
Flames,&rdquo; was most amazing. A fresh truck load,
three or four hundred copies, had come down that
very morning. By mid-afternoon they were two-thirds
gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>For a time, as she watched, Lucile&rsquo;s astonishment
grew; then it began to ebb. She was
learning the secret of it. Laurie Seymour hovered
over the pile constantly. Hardly a customer left
him without purchasing one or more copies.
Apparently well informed regarding the contents
of the book, he told still more regarding
the personality of the author and how he had
gone about the task of gathering the material.
All of the local color of the book was penned
with minute exactness; the characters were true
to life; their actions, while not pedantic, were
such as would lead girls and boys to higher
thinking and unselfish living. More than that,
the story contained precisely the elements which
young people of to-day demand. Action, adventure,
suspense, mystery&mdash;all were here in
proper and generous proportions. Thus he
would describe the book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he would assure the prospective purchaser,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s this year&rsquo;s publication; not six
weeks off the press and it sells for a dollar. How
is that possible? That it might have a large
sale the author cut his royalty to one-third, and
the publishers cut their profits accordingly. The
book compares favorably with many a book selling
for nearly twice the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What customer could refuse such a book?
Few did. Even more important than this was
the fact that the other salespeople, especially
those who were new and had little knowledge
of the stock but who were zealous for quick
sales, listened to his lucid story of the book, and
having learned it by heart, joined in selling it.
There were times when clerks fluttered as
thickly about that pile of books as sparrows
around a crust of bread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Laurie Seymour; why is he so
greatly interested in that particular book, and
how does he come to know so much about it?&rdquo;
Having put these questions to herself, Lucile
went about the task of asking others about him.
She asked Rennie and Donnie, the inseparable
two who had worked in that corner so long.
She searched out Tommie, the young man of
twenty who knew all about boys&rsquo; books. She
asked Morrison, of the fine bindings section, and
even Emmy, the veteran inspector. All shook
their heads. They had come down one morning,
and there he was selling books. That had
been two weeks previous. Someone had pulled
some wires and here he was. By-and-by the rush
would be over, then out he would go. That
was the way things were done at Christmas time.
It wasn&rsquo;t worth while to care too much!</p>
<p>But Lucile did care. Her curiosity had been
aroused. She wanted to know more about
Laurie Seymour.</p>
<p>Her curiosity was given a trace of satisfaction
that very evening. At least she found out who
knew about Laurie. Yes, she found out, but
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>She had come hurrying round a pillar when
she all but ran into Laurie. He had been talking
in low tones and laughing in notes quite
as low. To her great surprise she saw that
the person he was talking to was none other
than the perfectly beautiful Miss Bruce, the
head of the section.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; Lucile said to herself, &ldquo;he
actually appeared to be joking her about something!
And he a sales-person! Ah well, our
chief is a star&mdash;would have been a star on any
stage, and a star has a right to be friendly with
any member of the cast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she smiled to herself, &ldquo;I know now
who could tell me all about Laurie Seymour;
but I&rsquo;d never dare ask. Never! I&rsquo;ll have to
find out some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One impression coming from this incident bore
down heavily upon her. Laurie Seymour was a
young man with a past broader than the four
walls of the juvenile book section. Just what
that past might have been, she could not guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;he is some
artist getting pictures from life; or an actor
gathering local color for a play, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your table in order?&rdquo; It was Rennie who
broke in upon her meditations.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, so she hurried away to forget, for
the time being, Laurie Seymour and her perplexing
problems.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />CORDIE&rsquo;S MAD FLIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Cordie, there&rsquo;s something I should tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordie looked up from the book she was
reading, stared at Lucile for a moment, then
with a toss of her pretty head exclaimed: &ldquo;If
you should, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at the end of another day. Some
time had passed since the Mystery Lady had
last appeared in the store. Work had increased;
crowds of buyers had grown denser, more insistent
in their demands. Two perpendicular
lines had appeared between Lucile&rsquo;s eyes. Cordie,
too, had felt the strain of it. Her nerves were
tense. She had been upon Lucile&rsquo;s bed for a
half hour, trying to relax. It was no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo; she demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it may frighten you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Frighten me?&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s eyes went wide
with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I think I should tell you. It may
put you on your guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordie sat bolt upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the time I found you&mdash;when
you fainted in the Art Museum?&rdquo; Lucile
asked in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t forget that. Wasn&rsquo;t it terrible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More terrible than you think, or at least
I believe it might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Cordie stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few seconds after you fainted, a strange
young man picked you up in his arms. He
said you were his sister. He started to carry
you out and would have, too, if I hadn&rsquo;t made
the guard stop him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; breathed Cordie, wild eyed, incredulous.
&ldquo;So that was what the guard meant
when he asked where my brother was? Oh,
how&mdash;how sort of romantic!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been,&rdquo; said Lucile in a very
sober tone. &ldquo;He may have been romantic, but
he also may have been very bad. That&rsquo;s why
I thought you ought to know. He may be
keeping a watch on you. Men who are fascinated
by a face often do. You ought not to
go alone upon the streets. You should not
have been alone that day. No girl from the
country, unacquainted with the ways of the
city, is safe alone upon its streets and within
its public buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m not&mdash;&rdquo; Cordie halted in the
midst of the sentence and began again. &ldquo;Did
you think&mdash;&rdquo; then drawing her lips tight as
if to keep in a secret that was about to escape,
she lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>When she broke the silence a moment later
the look on her face was very serious. &ldquo;I do
realize the danger,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Truly
I do. I will be careful, very, very careful. It
was wonderful of you to save me from that&mdash;that
man. How can I ever thank you enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hopping down from the bed, she wound her
arm about Lucile and planted a kiss upon her
forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Just at that instant a question entered Lucile&rsquo;s
mind. &ldquo;I wonder when her appreciation will
reach down as deep as her pocketbook? That&rsquo;s
a sordid thought. I ought not to think it,&rdquo; she
told herself, &ldquo;but I just can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile was having to pay an increased rent
on her room because of the girl&rsquo;s occupying it
with her. A pay day had come and gone, yet
her young charge had shown no desire to bear
her share of this burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! I mustn&rsquo;t let myself wonder that,&rdquo;
Lucile corrected herself stoutly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll pay
when she can. She&rsquo;s probably saving up for
her rent which is in arrears somewhere else.
I do wonder, though, what she was about to
tell me when she said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not&mdash;&rsquo; and &lsquo;Did
you think&mdash;&rsquo; I truly wish she&rsquo;d tell me about
herself, but I can wait her time for revealing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Half of the following day had not passed
before Lucile repented having told Cordie of
her volunteer brother. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably never
be seen again by any of us,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;and now look at the poor girl. She&rsquo;s all unnerved;
grips her desk and stares in a frightened
manner every time a man looks at her.
And yet,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;if anything happened
and I hadn&rsquo;t told her I&rsquo;d never forgiven myself.
Surely life is full of perplexing problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ere that day was done something was destined
to happen which would make this particular
problem many times more perplexing. Since
she knew nothing of this, Lucile went serenely
on selling books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something,&rdquo; said Rennie, the
veteran book-seller, who had apparently made
an excuse for going to lunch with Lucile that
day. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re letting this work get on your
nerves. Look at those puckers between your
eyes. It&rsquo;s no use. You mustn&rsquo;t let it. You&rsquo;ll
go to pieces and it&rsquo;s not worth it. You&rsquo;ve got
your life to live. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Rennie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Rennie held up a finger for silence. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
young; haven&rsquo;t learned the gospel of repose.
You, perhaps, think of repose as the curling of
one&rsquo;s self up in a soft-cushioned chair. That&rsquo;s
not repose; it&rsquo;s stagnation. Did you ever see a
tiny bird balancing himself on a twig over a
rushing waterfall and singing his little heart
away? That&rsquo;s repose. You can have poise and
repose in the midst of the crowding throng.
The bird, only half conscious of the rushing
water beneath him, sings the more sweetly because
of it. We, too, may have our service
sweetened by the very rush of things if we
will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is service! You believe that, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a new light in the veteran saleslady&rsquo;s
eyes. Lucile, as she looked at her frail
body, thought to herself: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s more spirit
than body. She&rsquo;s given half herself away in
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes,&rdquo; she replied slowly, &ldquo;I suppose
selling juvenile books is a service in a way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You suppose!&rdquo; Rennie gripped her arm
until it hurt. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it is? It may
be made a great, a wonderful service. There
are books and books. You have read many of
them. You know them. You are young. You
have read. Some you have loved, some despised.
Which do you sell? Which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the ones I love, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. Being endowed by nature
with taste, good taste, and having had that
taste improved by education, you are able to
choose the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Books are like water. Some are like foam,
the white caps of the sea; pure enough but
effervescent. They pass in a moment and are
lost forever. Others are like scum from a stagnant
pool; they are poison. Then there are
those blessed others which are like the cool, pure,
refreshing water that comes bubbling up from a
mountain spring. Reading has an untold and
lasting influence on a child. Do you believe
that? When you have put one of those better
books into the hand of a boy or girl, you have
conferred a lasting blessing upon someone. Do
you believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do. Now, when you go back
to your work this afternoon, do it with the consciousness
that you are really being a benefactor
to your generation. Say to yourself: &lsquo;See all
those people. Some of these are to go away
from here this afternoon richer because I have
been here to serve them, to advise them, to select
for them the thing they really need.&rsquo; Then
watch the little annoyances, the petty troubles
that tempt you to fret, &lsquo;Fold their tents like
the Arabs and silently steal away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sales-people?&rdquo; Rennie continued. &ldquo;Why,
we are far more than that. We may, if we will,
take our place beside teachers, nurses, librarians,
and all those whose names will be written high
on the tablet of the future where will appear
all those who have truly benefited their race.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; she smiled again, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to preach, but really I hope it may do
you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it will.&rdquo; There was a mist
in the girl&rsquo;s eyes as she said this. She had
caught a vision of what real life work meant
to this frail woman. Once more she was
tempted to give up her education in favor of a
career as a vendor of juvenile books.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>At ten minutes before closing time Lucile,
having promised to meet Cordie at the northeast
door, hurried down the stairs to the first
floor. Then things began to happen with lightning-like
rapidity.</p>
<p>She had just started on her little journey
across the store to the northeast entrance when,
all in a flash, she caught sight of a hand, such
a hand as she had seen but once and would
never forget. The long, slim, muscular fingers
and the ring of the dragon&rsquo;s head were there.
She could not be mistaken. Somewhere in that
jostling throng was the Mystery Lady. And&mdash;yes,
Lucile was sure of it, there she was off
there to the right. She could not mistake that
face. With a bound she was after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast there! Not so fast!&rdquo; exclaimed
a floor man. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any fire.
What made you think there was?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Wedged in between a tall lady from the city
and a very broad-shouldered, bear-skin coated
man from the country, Lucile could but heed the
floorman&rsquo;s admonition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s making for the door,&rdquo; she whispered
breathlessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow her out. Can&rsquo;t fail
to catch her in the street. I&rsquo;ll get her before she
has gone a block. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah yes, and then&mdash;well, she&rsquo;d decide what
was to be done when the time came. She&rsquo;d
trust to inspiration.</p>
<p>She did not catch up with her in the first
block, nor the second or third, either. The
sidewalks were rivers of people; the cross streets
filled with automobiles. Considering the fact
that this was an obstacle race of an exceedingly
unusual type, the Mystery Lady made wonderful
progress. As for Lucile, she was not to be
outdone; indeed, she gained a little here, and a
little there. She dodged through an open space
on the sidewalk and sprinted down a stretch of
street where no autos were parked or traveling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get her in the next block,&rdquo; she
panted. &ldquo;Suppose there&rsquo;ll be a scene, but who
cares? Here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>A policeman&rsquo;s whistle, releasing the flood of
autos on the cross street, had just blown. With
a leap she sprang away before them. Grazed
by the wheel of a gray sedan, drawing an angry
hoot from a huge touring car, she crossed the
channel and was about to dash on when a hand
seized her firmly by the arm and gave her such
a turn as fairly set her whirling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you!&rdquo; exclaimed a gruff voice.
&ldquo;What you tryin&rsquo; to do? Tryin&rsquo; to commit
suicide? Autos has their right as well as them
that walks. Give &rsquo;em their turn, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was there to do? She could not tell this
policeman of her cause for speed. She could
but stand there panting until he chose to release
her. And as she stood there, with time to
think, a startling question came to her mind:
&ldquo;Cordie! What of Cordie? I promised to
meet her at the northeast entrance! Closing
time has now passed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment her head whirled, but as the
grip on her arm relaxed she murmured:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever is to happen has happened
back there. I&rsquo;ll get madamoiselle of mysteries
yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she crept slowly away until she was
lost from sight of the officer; then again raced
on at breakneck speed.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>She was right. Something indeed had happened
by the door of the northeast entrance.
Cordie had been prompt in keeping her appointment;
especially so since her nerves, disturbed
by Lucile&rsquo;s revelation of the night before,
were on edge.</p>
<p>Surprised at not finding Lucile waiting for
her, she had moved back into a secluded
alcove to watch the passing throng crowd
through the doors.</p>
<p>Crowds always amused her. Some of the
people were short and some tall; some young,
some old; but all were interesting. Each had
his story to tell if only he could be induced to
tell it. This is why the flow of a river of people
is so interesting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Just when it was that her attention was
drawn from the moving throng to a single stationary
individual, the girl could not tell. The
instant she saw the man she felt he had been
watching her; felt too that she had recognized
in him her volunteer brother of the Art Museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered as cold dread gripped
her heart, &ldquo;there is the hawk-like eye, the marble
face. It is he. Oh! How shall I escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Losing her power to reason, she dashed away
from the door and into the crowd that was
now thronging toward the exits.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Lucile found it rather difficult to again locate
the Mystery Lady. When at last she succeeded
it was to get a good square look at her, the
first she had been afforded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strangely she is dressed!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Like some countrywoman come to the
city for shopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second she was inclined to doubt her
judgment. It could not be the lady&mdash;yet, yes,
there was her profile. There could be no mistake;
so, again she dashed along after her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Although she maintained a pace that appeared
to be a leisurely one, the Mystery Lady was
hard enough to overtake. Turning to the right,
she crossed two streets to at last come out upon
the Boulevard. Swinging to the left, she joined
the home-going throng.</p>
<p>Lucile, gaining moment by moment, was all
but upon her when she turned quickly to enter
a broad, open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I have you!&rdquo; Lucile murmured.</p>
<p>She passed through the broad door just in
time to see the mysterious one push back a
heavy curtain and disappear.</p>
<p>Lucile was about to follow, when a guard,
touching her on the shoulder, demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why no,&rdquo; Lucile stood there nonplussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Opera Hall. You can&rsquo;t go back of
that curtain without a pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but that lady gave you no pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard made no reply. He merely shrugged
and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Dropping back a step or two, Lucile stood staring
at the curtain. Her head was whirling.
What a strangely privileged woman this one
must be. She entered and left a great department
store at two hours before midnight, and
no one said to her &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She steps into a
vestibule of a great musical hall and passes behind
the curtain without a pass. What would
she do next?</p>
<p>Suspended from one brass post to another, a
heavy silk rope hung before the curtain. There
were gaps in the curtain. Through one of these
gaps, as Lucile stood staring at it, a hand was
thrust. It was the hand of the mysterious lady.
And upon it, beside the dragon&rsquo;s head ring, was
another. And this ring one more unusual and
startling than the other. It was the iron ring of
a bundle wrapper!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cordie&rsquo;s ring,&rdquo; Lucile whispered, &ldquo;and, as
I live, a diamond has been set in it. A magnificent
diamond, worth hundreds of dollars! How
strange! How weird! A diamond set in iron!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Even as she thought this, the hand disappeared.
Instantly the heavy purple curtain began to sway.
Expecting anything, the girl stood there breathless.
A needle flashed twice through the cloth
of the curtain, then in its place there appeared
a tiny spot of crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crimson thread!&rdquo; Lucile whispered.
&ldquo;And I may not pass beyond the curtain!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />THE DIAMOND-SET IRON RING</h2>
<p>When Cordie fled from the man of the hawk-like
eye and the marble features she dashed
directly into the moving throng of shoppers. In
this, however, she found scant relief. No matter
which way she might turn she felt sure that the
man pursued her and would overtake her if she
did not flee faster and faster.</p>
<p>Putting her utmost strength into this flight,
she dashed past counters strewn with goods,
round a bank of elevators, through narrow
aisles jammed with shoppers, across a narrow
court and again into the throng. At last, in utter
desperation, she fled down a stairway; then
another and another. Little dreaming that she
had been descending into the very depths of
the earth, she came up at last with a little suppressed
scream to a place where from out a long
row of small iron doors fire gleamed red as a
noonday sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Where was she? Surely she had not dreamed
there could be such a place as this in a great
department store.</p>
<p>After wavering unsteadily for a moment, she
turned, stumbled, righted herself, and would
have gone racing back up the stair had not a
heavy hand fallen upon her shoulder and a
gruff, kindly voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Miss Cordelia, are you in
trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprised at hearing herself called by her
own name, she turned about to find herself staring
into the face of James, the bundle man.</p>
<p>For a few seconds she wavered between pause
and flight. There was, however, such a light
of kindness in the man&rsquo;s eyes as could not be
questioned. So, stepping back from the stairs,
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am in trouble. The&mdash;the man; I
think he was following me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d do well not to follow you too far this
way, if he meant you any harm.&rdquo; The bundle
man shook his powerful frame, then glanced
at the fires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what are they?&rdquo; Cordie stammered.
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; he looked incredulous.
&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the boilers that heat the buildin&rsquo;. I
suppose you never wondered before how this
huge building got heated? Well, that&rsquo;s how.
Them&rsquo;s the boilers that does it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I come down here to sit after
hours,&rdquo; he half apologized. &ldquo;The boys down
here that tends to the stokers let me come. I
like it. It&rsquo;s the nearest thing to the sea that
one finds about the buildin&rsquo;. You see, it&rsquo;s sort
of like a ship&rsquo;s hold where the stokers work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you belong to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it; but that
will do for another time. You&rsquo;ll be going home.
If it&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ll see you safely on your way,
or if you want I&rsquo;ll see you safely home. You
need have no fear of me. I&rsquo;m old enough to
be your father, an&rsquo; I took a sort of interest in
you from the first. I&rsquo;d be glad to help you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>He broke short off to stare at the door through
which Cordie had entered. Framed by the outer
darkness, a face had appeared there. However
well shaven and massaged it might be, it was
not a pleasing face to look upon and hawk-like
eyes were set in a countenance as expressionless
as marble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; whispered James, staring as
if his eyes would pop out of his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the very man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant the man disappeared. There
was reason enough for this too, for with every
muscle of his face drawn in lines of hate, the
stalwart James had leaped square at the door.</p>
<p>And what of Lucile?</p>
<p>After gazing for a moment in astonishment
at the purple curtain with the touch of crimson
shining out from it, (beyond which the Mystery
Lady had disappeared,) she stepped close enough
to make sure that same purple strand ran
through the thread. Then she turned and
walked out of the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>She found herself more mystified than ever.
When would all this maze of mysteries be
solved? Why had the Mystery Lady done
that? Why the crimson thread? Why the iron
ring? That was the fourth time the crimson
thread had appeared, and this time there could
be no doubt but that it had been she who had
held the needle.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at this moment there
flashed through her mind one sentence in that
clipping relating to the lady who called herself
the Spirit of Christmas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Spirit of Christmas,&rdquo; she whispered
it as she recalled it. &ldquo;I am the Spirit of Christmas.
Wherever I go I leave my mark which
is also my sign.&rdquo; She wondered vaguely what
she could have meant by that.</p>
<p>This lady of the Christmas Spirit had the
whole city on tip-toes. Everyone was looking
for her; everyone hoping to come downtown
some fine morning to meet her and to claim her
bag of gold. Shoppers gazed into faces of fellow
shoppers to wonder: &ldquo;Are you the Spirit
of Christmas? Shall I grasp your hand?&rdquo; News
boys, staring up at lady customers who slipped
them pennies for papers, wondered: &ldquo;Are you
the Christmas Lady?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Every day the paper told how she had been
dressed on the previous day, where she had been
and what she had done. One day, in the guise of
a farmer&rsquo;s wife, she had visited the stockyards
and had spent hours wandering through great
buildings or on board-walks above the cattle.
The next day found her again among the throngs
of shoppers. Here she had purchased a handkerchief
and there a newspaper. She described the
clerk and the newsboy. The clerk and the boy
read it and groaned. For them the great moment
had come and was gone forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will discover her? When will it be?
Who will get the gold?&rdquo; These were the questions
that were on every tongue.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt but the paper was
reaping a golden harvest from it, for did not
everyone in the city buy a paper that they
might read of her latest exploits and to discover
where she was to be on that day, and to
dream that this day he might be the lucky one;
this day he might hear the gold coin jingle?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Lucile thought all this through as she hurried
back toward the store. At the same time she
chided herself for being so foolish as to miss her
appointment with Cordie for such a wild goose
chase. She hoped against hope that she would
find Cordie still waiting.</p>
<p>She found the door closed. As she pressed her
face against the glass she saw but one person
near the entrance&mdash;the night watchman. Cordie
was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; Lucile murmured. &ldquo;I only hope
nothing has happened to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she turned about and raced away to
catch an on-coming elevated train.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>As James disappeared through the door of the
furnace room of the department store, Cordie
sank down in a chair. The chair was black and
greasy, but she had no thought for that. Indeed,
so excited and frightened was she that for a
time she was unable to think clearly about anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>When at last the full meaning of the situation
had forced its way into her consciousness, she
leaped to her feet, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him! Stop him! He&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; a burly furnace tender
smiled quietly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a hard boiled egg, that
boy; muscles like steel and quick as a cat. If
anybody does him in you&rsquo;ll have to give him
credit. Y&rsquo;ought t&rsquo; see him box. There ain&rsquo;t a
man among us that can touch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat reassured by this glowing description
of her companion, the girl settled back
again in her seat. She knew that she was safe
enough here with these rough but kindly men.</p>
<p>As she sat there thinking, there came to her
mind a question. Why did James go into such
a fit of anger at sight of the stranger at the
door?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;it could not have
been because the man had been following me.
That wouldn&rsquo;t be natural. James scarcely knows
me. Why should he suddenly become such a
violent champion of my cause? And besides,
he had no way of knowing that that was the man
who was following me. He did not wait to ask
a single question; just whispered: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rsquo;
and rushed right at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No he didn&rsquo;t do it because of me,&rdquo; she concluded
after a few moments of thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
seen that man before. I wonder when and
where. I wonder what he&rsquo;s done to James?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came another, more startling question.
What would James do to the man if he caught
him?</p>
<p>Instantly her keen imagination was at work.
Quickening her sense of hearing, it set her
listening to sounds which she told herself were
the dull thud of fist-blows, the sickening rush of
a blade as it sped through the air, a low groan
of pain, and then sharper, more distinct, the
pop-pop of an automatic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>In vain she told herself that with the hiss of
steam, the dull thud-thud of revolving grates and
the general noises of the boiler-room, it was
quite impossible for her to distinguish sounds
ten yards away, and that in all probability the
two men were hundreds of feet away from her,
on some other floor. The illusion still persisted.
So certain did she become that a battle was being
fought just outside the door that she found
herself gripping the arms of her chair to keep
from crying out.</p>
<p>The nickel-plated clock against the wall had
ticked away a full half hour. The suspense had
grown unbearable when of a sudden, with
face grimy, hair tousled, and clothing all awry,
James appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you,&rdquo; Cordie started up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss,&rdquo; James grinned. &ldquo;I know I
look as if I&rsquo;d come in from a long and stormy
voyage. My deck needs swabbin&rsquo; down and my
sails a furlin&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;ll be shipshape and ready
to take another cruise before the clock can
strike eight bells.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>This talk sounded so quaint to the girl that
she quite forgot the recent danger James had
been in, and sat staring at him as he thrust his
head into a huge basin of water and proceeded
to scrub it with a course brush, much as one
might some huge vegetable.</p>
<p>By the aid of a comb and whisk broom, he
succeeded in making himself presentable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he smiled a broad smile, &ldquo;your Uncle
James, once a seaman and now a land fighter, is
ready to pilot you home. What&rsquo;s the port?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty-first and Drexel,&rdquo; said Cordie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Port &rsquo;er bow. We&rsquo;re off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning his recent combat&mdash;if there had
been a combat&mdash;James said not a word. Cordie
wondered at this, but eager as she was to know
the outcome of the battle, if there had been one,
she dreaded quite as much to hear the whole
truth. Visions of an inanimate form, lying
bruised and bleeding in some dark corner of the
stair, set her shuddering. So in the end she
asked no question.</p>
<p>Their passage to the upper floor and out of
the building was uneventful. The watchman at
the door recognized them and allowed them to
pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Previous to this time James had seemed quiet
and uncommunicative, but now as they rattled
along on the L train he told her many a wild tale
of the sea journeys he had made. In his deep
mellow drawl he talked of the whale ship <i>Addler</i>
in northern seas; of Eskimo and polar bear and
the gleaming northern lights; and then he talked
of the Cutter <i>Corwin</i> among the palm shadowed
South Sea Islands.</p>
<p>It was with a real feeling of regret that
Cordie, hearing her own station announced,
realized that their visit was at an end.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, brimming over with excitement,
she burst into Lucile&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile as she read in
Cordie&rsquo;s eyes the story of some thrilling experience.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had an adventure. So have
I. Let&rsquo;s not spoil &rsquo;em in the telling. Let&rsquo;s set
the stage for a story. You haven&rsquo;t had a bite to
eat, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o,&rdquo; Cordie admitted, &ldquo;not a single
bite. I&rsquo;d forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have I. You&rsquo;ll find a loaf of bread
and a slice of cream pimento cheese in the upper
dresser drawer. There are some vanilla wafers,
too. You make the sandwiches and I&rsquo;ll have the
cocoa piping hot in a minute. No, I&rsquo;ll tell you,
let&rsquo;s dress for it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later they sat in their bright
colored dressing gowns, sipping the delicious hot
beverage and hungrily devouring sandwiches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Lucile after the last sandwich
had vanished and fresh cups had been poured,
&ldquo;now&rsquo;s the time for spinning yarns. You tell
yours first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many a gesture and dramatic pause,
Cordie told of her startling discovery, her wild
dash through the throng, her descent into the
depths of the earth, and of the strange doings
down there beneath the surface of the city&rsquo;s
streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lucile, sipping her chocolate
thoughtfully as Cordie&rsquo;s narrative ended, &ldquo;that
surely was the young man who attempted to
carry you away when you fainted in the Art
Museum. Dear little girl, you must be careful,
very careful indeed. You must never be left
alone; never! Never! Even if the Mystery
Woman beckons or the Lady of the Christmas
Spirit clinks her gold in my very ears, I will
not desert you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a very warm and friendly hand that
Lucile felt tucked into her own, and a suspiciously
husky voice that said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear big sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Cordie exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;I must
not tell them. It would never do. They
wouldn&rsquo;t let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly checking her speech as if about to
unwittingly reveal a secret, she changed the subject
abruptly. &ldquo;Please tell me of your adventure,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My adventure?&rdquo; smiled Lucile. &ldquo;Compared
with yours, it was no adventure at all&mdash;merely
an episode. However, since it throws
some light on a mystery and reveals the whereabouts
of a bit of stolen property, I must tell
you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Then, while Cordie leaned back among the
cushions, her eyes half closed as if she were
day dreaming, Lucile told of her experience with
the Mystery Lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My iron ring!&rdquo; exclaimed Cordie, sitting
bolt upright as Lucile came to that part of the
story. &ldquo;My iron ring! The old mischief! I
might have known! I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Cordie checked herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have known what?&rdquo; asked Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have known that someone had stolen
it, I suppose,&rdquo; finished Cordie lamely. &ldquo;Anyway,
someone did, didn&rsquo;t they? And isn&rsquo;t it
funny that she should have a diamond set in
it? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a joke to come upon her
wearing it? Wouldn&rsquo;t it, though? I&rsquo;d march
right up and say, &lsquo;Lay-d-e-e give me the ring!
You stole it. My precious, my onliest, only iron
ring!&rsquo;&rdquo; She threw back her head and laughed.</p>
<p>Lucile joined her in the laugh, and with this
forgot for a time that Cordie had said something
very unusual about the ring and the lady who
had taken it. At last Cordie broke the silence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;James is a very unusual person.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he caught that man&mdash;the
one who had been following me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, but perhaps not. You say he was
all mussed up when he came back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not bruised, nor bloody, nor anything
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not&mdash;no, not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then probably he didn&rsquo;t. When I got
through my wild race about the place the other
night I was good and mussed up, and I hadn&rsquo;t
been in a fight either. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to
catch anyone in that labyrinth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was silence for a little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucile,&rdquo; whispered Cordie, bending forward
eagerly, her face alight with some strange idea.
&ldquo;James is so mysterious. Do you suppose he
could be a pirate in hiding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pirate! Why child, there aren&rsquo;t any
pirates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t read about any, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t read about lots of things. You
never read about my wrapping bundles, did you?
But I am, just the same. Everything doesn&rsquo;t get
in the papers. I think it would be wonderful
if he turned out to be a real pirate. You&rsquo;d think
he was one if you heard some of the stories he
told me to-night about the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; laughed her companion, &ldquo;if you
can make him out a pirate, a nice friendly sort
of pirate who is kind to ladies and all that,
you&rsquo;re welcome. But for my part, I&rsquo;d give a
lot more to know what that self appointed
brother of yours has done to James. It must
have been something rather terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Cordie, &ldquo;it surely must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile. &ldquo;There go the
chimes! Ten o&rsquo;clock, and you work in the
morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping from her chair, she began cleaning
up the remnants of their little feast. Ten
minutes later the room was darkened for the
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Though the room was dark, and though Lucile
was tired enough for sleep, her eyes did not close
at once. She was thinking and her thoughts
were not of the most cheerful sort.</p>
<p>The outlook, she was forced to admit, was
gloomy enough. She had hoped to save enough
money from her pay at the store to start her
in the new term at school. This hope was fast
dwindling away. Her own expenses had been
greater than she had thought they would be.
Added to this was the increase in her room
rent due to the presence of Cordie. Her dream
that Cordie was saving money had been blighted
only the night before, for on that night Cordie
had brought home the gorgeous dressing gown
she had worn as they sat over the cocoa cups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it must have cost her every penny she
possessed,&rdquo; groaned Lucile. &ldquo;How extravagant!
How&mdash;how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to say ungrateful, but could not
quite do it. The girl appeared so impractical,
so lovable, so irresponsible, that she could not
find the heart to blame her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>Quickly she switched her thoughts to a more
cheering subject&mdash;Laurie Seymour. He had
proven such a jolly fellow-worker&mdash;so cheerful,
so kind and helpful, so ever ready to bear the
heavy burdens&mdash;that Lucile had all but forgotten
the fact that he had given his pass-out to
the Mystery Lady on that night when she had in
such a surprising manner come into the possession
of the valuable fur lined cape. Equally
strange was the fact that she had come to think
of the Mystery Lady in a new way. She found
that she could no longer think of the lady as
a thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;what could have
been her reason for haunting our store at that
hour of the night? Why should she have left the
cape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cape. Ah yes, there was vexation enough
in that! Too precious to be worn to work, it
had hung for days in Lucile&rsquo;s closet while she
had gone to work all too scantily clad in a
sweater and broad scarf. She wished that she
might have her own coat. Poor as it might be,
it was at least her own and it was comfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Next morning, having arrived at the door of
the store a full fifteen minutes before the opening
hour, the two girls were enjoying a few
moments of window shopping before the gorgeous
windows of State street. Suddenly, above
the rattle of distant elevated trains and the
honk of auto horns, Lucile caught clear and distinct
the calling neigh of a horse.</p>
<p>Wheeling quickly about, she stared around
her. True enough, there were still many horses
on the streets of the city, but where before,
in the din and rattle of the streets, had she
caught that one clear call of a horse?</p>
<p>What she saw caused her to start and stare.
Cordie was no longer at her side. Instead she
was in imminent danger of being run down by a
cab as she dashed madly across the street toward
the spot where, like a statue in blue, a
young policeman sat rigidly erect on his police
horse.</p>
<p>The thing the girl did, once she had safely
crossed the street, was even more surprising.
Without the least glance at the young policeman,
she threw both arms about the horse&rsquo;s neck and
hid her face in his mane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Far from objecting to this unusual procedure,
the horse appeared to rather enjoy it. As for
the stern young minion of the law, he was so
overcome by surprise that he did not alter his
statue-like pose by so much as a movement of
a finger.</p>
<p>Lucile flew across the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cordie! Cordie! What in the world are
you doing?&rdquo; she fairly screamed.</p>
<p>Paying not the least attention to this, Cordie
repeated over and over: &ldquo;Dick, you old darling.
Dear old Dick. You knew me, Dick, you
did! You did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lasted for a full moment. Then, appearing
to come to herself, the girl dropped her
hands and stepped back upon the sidewalk.</p>
<p>One glance at the stern young officer, and a
quite different emotion swept over her. Her
face turned crimson as she stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what have I done? I&mdash;I beg&mdash;beg
your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; grinned the young man, coming
to life with a broad smile. &ldquo;Friend of
yours, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;Oh yes,&mdash;a very, very good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Patrick O&rsquo;Hara,&rdquo; there was a
comradely tone now in the young officer&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine too, and a mighty good
one. Shake.&rdquo; Solemnly drawing off his gauntlet,
he swung half way out of his saddle to
grasp the girl&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Thanks awfully. Is this&mdash;this
where you always stay? I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to see
Dick real often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my beat; from here to the next cross
street and back again. I&rsquo;m here every morning
from seven to one. We&mdash;we&mdash;Dick, I mean,
will be glad to see you.&rdquo; The way he smiled as
he looked at Cordie&rsquo;s deep colored, dimpled
cheeks, her frank blue eyes, her crinkly hair,
said plainer than words: &ldquo;Dick won&rsquo;t be the
only one who will be glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lucile,&rdquo; implored Cordie, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d do
me a favor. I haven&rsquo;t a lump of sugar for poor
old Dick. I can&rsquo;t leave him this way. I&mdash;I
never have. Won&rsquo;t you please talk to this&mdash;this
policeman until I can go to the restaurant on the
corner and get some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cordie,&rdquo; prompted the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Cordie,&rdquo; Patrick O&rsquo;Hara grinned,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not run away. Duty calls me, though.
I must ride up a block and back again. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
make it snappy. Be back before you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touching Dick with his spurless heel and patting
him gently on the neck, he went trotting
away.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the lump of sugar ceremony
having been performed to the complete
satisfaction of both Dick and Cordie, the girls
hurried away to the scenes of their daily labors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>This little drama made a profound impression
upon Lucile. For one thing, it convinced her
that in spite of her expensive and stylish lingerie,
Cordie was indeed a little country girl. &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
Lucille told herself, &ldquo;that horse, Dick, came
from the country. All horses do. He&rsquo;s been a
pet of Cordie&rsquo;s back there on the farm. His
owner, perhaps her own father, has sold him to
some city dealer. And because he is such a
thorobred and such a fine up-standing beauty, he
has been made a police horse. I don&rsquo;t blame
her for loving him. Anyone would. But it
shows what a splendid, affectionate girl she is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of glad,&rdquo; she told herself a moment
later, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s gotten acquainted with that
young officer, Patrick O&rsquo;Hara. He seems such
a nice sort of boy, and then you can never tell
how soon you&rsquo;re going to need a policeman as a
friend; at least it seems so from what happened
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She might have shuddered a little had she
known how prophetic these thoughts were. As
it was, she merely smiled as she recalled once
more how her impetuous little companion had
raced across the streets to throw her arms about
the neck of a horse ridden by a strange policeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she said finally, &ldquo;I do wonder
why Cordie does not confide in me? Oh well,&rdquo;
she sighed, &ldquo;I can only wait. The time will
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she but known it, Cordie had reasons
enough; the strangest sort of reasons, too.</p>
<p>It was in the forenoon of that same day that
a rather surprising thing happened, a thing that
doubled the mystery surrounding the attractive
young salesman, Laurie.</p>
<p>Lucile was delivering a book to a customer.
Laurie was waiting at the desk for change and at
the same time whispering to Cordie, when of
a sudden his eyes appeared ready to start from
his head as he muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant, leaving wrapped package,
change and customer, he disappeared as if the
floor had dropped from beneath him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Laurie?&rdquo; Cordie asked a moment
later. &ldquo;His customer&rsquo;s waiting for her change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Lucile didn&rsquo;t know where he was, she
was quite sure he would not return, at least he
would not until a certain short, broad-shouldered
man, who carried a large brief case and stood
talking to Rennie, had left the section. She felt
very sure that Laurie wished to escape meeting
this man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That man must be Sam,&rdquo; Lucile thought to
herself as she volunteered to complete Laurie&rsquo;s
sale. &ldquo;Now I wonder what makes him so much
afraid of that man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks like a detective,&rdquo; she thought to
herself as she got a better look at him. &ldquo;No, he
smiles too much for that. Must be a salesman
trying to get Rennie to buy more books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation she overheard tended to
confirm this last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a thousand,&rdquo; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; Rennie threw her hands up
in mock horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! All right,&rdquo; Sam smiled. &ldquo;Anything
you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having been called away by a rush of customers,
Lucile had quite forgotten both Laurie
and Sam when she came suddenly upon the large
brief case which Sam had carried. It was
lying on her table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whose is that?&rdquo; a voice said over her
shoulder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Sam&rsquo;s, confound him! He&rsquo;s
always leaving things about. Now he&rsquo;ll have to
come back for it and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Sam?&rdquo; Lucile asked.</p>
<p>She turned about to receive the answer. The
answer did not come. For a second time that
day Laurie had vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />HER DOUBLE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Two more shopping days before Christmas,&rdquo;
Lucile read these words in the paper on the
following morning as she stepped into the elevator
which was to take her to a day of strenuous
labor. She read them and sighed. Then,
of a sudden, she started and stared. The cause
of this sudden change was the elevator girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Florence!&rdquo; she exclaimed half incredulous.
&ldquo;You here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why not?&rdquo; smiled the big, athletic
looking girl who handled the elevator with skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know I needed the money badly
enough,&rdquo; laughed Florence. &ldquo;Well, I do.
Seems that one is always running out of cash,
especially when it comes near to Christmas. I
was getting short, so I came down here and
they gave me this job. Thought I could stand
the rush I guess,&rdquo; she smiled as she put one arm
about her former chum in a bear-like embrace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>If you have read our other books, &ldquo;The
Cruise of the O&rsquo;Moo&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Secret Mark,&rdquo;
you will remember that these two girls had been
the best of chums. But a great University
is a place of many changes. Their paths had
crossed and then they had gone in diverging
ways. Now they were more than pleased to
find that, for a time, they were employed in the
same store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Christmas,&rdquo; said Florence,
&ldquo;since I haven&rsquo;t any grand Christmas surprises
coming from other people, I&rsquo;ve decided to buy
myself a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you do that?&rdquo; asked Lucile, a look
of incredulity on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my floor. See you later.&rdquo; Lucile
sprang from the elevator and was away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to meet old friends,&rdquo; the elevator
girl thought to herself as she went speeding up
the shaft, &ldquo;especially when the holiday season
is near. I must try to see more of Lucile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running an elevator in a department store is
a dull task. Little enough adventure in that,
you might say, except when your cable begins
to slip with a full load on board. But Florence
was destined to come under the spell of mystery
and to experience thrilling adventure before
her short service as an elevator girl came to
an end.</p>
<p>Mystery came leaping at her right out of the
morning. She left her car in the basement and
went for a drink. She was gone but a second.
When she came back the elevator door was
closed and the cage cables in motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I never heard of
such a thing. Who could have taken it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have been the engineer taking it for
a testing trip,&rdquo; she thought after a few seconds
of deliberation. &ldquo;But no, that doesn&rsquo;t
seem probable. He&rsquo;d not be down this early.
But who could it be? And why did they do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>If the disappearance of her car had been
startling, the thing she witnessed three minutes
later was many times more so.</p>
<p>With fast beating heart she saw the shadow
of the car move down from fifth floor to fourth,
from fourth to third, then saw the car itself
cover the remaining distance to the basement.</p>
<p>Her knees trembled with excitement and fear
as she watched the cage in its final drop. The
excitement was born of curiosity; the fear was
that this should mean the last of her position.
She had never been discharged and this gave
her an unwonted dread of it.</p>
<p>The car came to a stop at the bottom. Three
passengers got off and one got on, and the car
shot upward again. And Florence did nothing
but stand there and stare in astonishment!</p>
<p>Had she seen a ghost, a ghost of herself?
What had happened? Her head was in a
whirl. The girl at the lever was herself.
Broad shoulders, large hands, round cheeks,
blue eyes, brown hair, even to freckles that
yielded not to winters indoors. It was her own
self, to the life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she reasoned, &ldquo;here I am down
here. What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she faced the situation more calmly, she
realized that the girl driving her car must be
her double, her perfect double. She remembered
reading somewhere that everyone in the
world had a double. And here was hers. But
why had her double made up her hair in her
exact fashion, donned an elevator girl&rsquo;s uniform
and taken her elevator from her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I must find out,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use making a scene by jumping
in and demanding my cage,&rdquo; she reasoned, after
a moment&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just get on as a
passenger and ride up with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something of a thrill in this affair.
She was beginning to enjoy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s fairly mysterious,&rdquo; she
breathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>In spite of all, she found herself anticipating
the next move in the little drama. Driving an
elevator was frightfully dull business. Going up
and down, up and down; answering innumerable
questions all day long about the location
of silks, shoes, baby rattle, nutmeg graters, boxing
gloves, garters and fly-swatters&mdash;this was
a dull task that tended to put one to sleep.
And often enough, after her noon luncheon, she
actually had to fight off sleep. But here, at
last, was a touch of mystery, romance and adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My double,&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out
who she is and why she did this, or die in the
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the cage moved downward.</p>
<p>This time, as the last customer moved out
of the door, she stepped in. Moving to the back
of the car, she stood breathlessly waiting for the
next move of her mysterious double.</p>
<p>The move did not come at once; in fact she
had to wait there in the back of the car a surprisingly
long time. The girl at the lever&mdash;her
double&mdash;had poise, this was easy enough
seen, and she had operated an elevator before,
too. She brought the cage to its position at
each floor with an exactness and precision that
could but be admired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>The cage filled at the first floor. It began to
empty at the third. By the time they had
reached the eleventh, only two passengers, beside
Florence, remained in the back of the car. Only
employees went beyond the eleventh; the floors
above were stock rooms.</p>
<p>The girl at the lever threw back a fleeting
glance. Florence thought she was about to
speak, but she did not.</p>
<p>The car went to the thirteenth landing. There
two people got off and three got on. Florence
remained. The car dropped from floor to floor
until they were again in the basement. Once
more the mysterious double gave Florence a
fleeting glance. She did not speak. Florence
did not move from her place in the corner.
The car rose again. To Florence the situation
was growing tense, unbearable.</p>
<p>Again the car emptied. At the eleventh floor
Florence found herself in the car alone with
her double. This gave her a strange, frightened
feeling, but she resolutely held her place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, turning about as
the car moved slowly upward. &ldquo;Let me run your
car, will you? Take my place, won&rsquo;t you? You
won&rsquo;t have a thing to do. It&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be a lark.&rdquo;
As she said all this in a whisper there was a
tense eagerness on her face that Florence could
not miss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but your car?&rdquo; she managed to
whisper back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t any. Don&rsquo;t go on until to-morrow.
Here&rsquo;s my locker key. Get&mdash;get my coat and
furs and hat out and wear them. Stay in the
store&mdash;Book Section and Rest Room. All you
have to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought, &ldquo;if
someone speaks to you, tells you something, you
say, &lsquo;Oh! All right.&rsquo; Just like that. And if
they ask you what you said, you repeat. That&rsquo;s
all you&rsquo;ll have to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t anything bad,&rdquo; the other girl put in
hastily. There was a sort of desperate eagerness
about the tense lines of her face. They
were nearing the thirteenth floor. &ldquo;Not a thing
that&rsquo;s bad&mdash;nor&mdash;nor anything you wouldn&rsquo;t
gladly do yourself. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll explain some time.
On&mdash;only do it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the thirteenth floor. She
pressed the key in Florence&rsquo;s reluctant hand.</p>
<p>A tall man, with an arm load of socks in
bundles, got on the car. He looked at Florence.
He looked at her double. Then he stared at
both of them. After that his large mouth spread
apart in a broad grin as he chuckled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later Florence found herself in
a kind of daze, standing at the tenth floor landing,
staring down at her steadily dropping car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she whispered, shaking herself
out of her daze, &ldquo;sort of a lark, I suppose. No
harm in it. Might as well have a half day off.&rdquo;
With that she turned and walked toward the
locker room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>The coat and hat she took from the mysterious
one&rsquo;s locker were very plain and somewhat worn,
not as good as her own. But the fur throw was
a thing to marvel at; a crossed fox, the real
thing, no dyed imitation, and so richly marked
with gray that it might easily be taken for a
silver gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some strange little combination,&rdquo; she
breathed as she threw the fur about her neck
and started once more for the elevator.</p>
<p>As a proof of the fact that she was carrying
out her share of the compact, she waited for
her own elevator. The strange girl shot her a
quick smile as she entered and another as she
got off on the third floor where was the rest
room and book section.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems terribly queer to be walking around
in another girl&rsquo;s clothes,&rdquo; she whispered to herself
as she drifted aimlessly past rows of people
resting in leather cushioned chairs. &ldquo;Especially
when that other girl is someone you&rsquo;ve
spoken to but once in your life. I wonder&mdash;I
do wonder why I did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She meditated on this question until she had
reached the book section.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was the look in her eyes; an eager,
haunted look. She&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;d swear to that,
and she&rsquo;s in some sort of trouble that&rsquo;s not all
her own fault. Trouble,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Part of
our reason for being here in the world is that
we may help others out of trouble. I&mdash;I guess
I&rsquo;m glad I did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this last she could not be sure. She had
sometimes been mistaken, had bestowed confidence
and assistance on persons who were unworthy.
Should this girl prove to be such a
person, then she might be helping her to get
away with some unlawful act. And she might
lose her position, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well,&rdquo; she sighed at last, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s done. I&rsquo;ll
lose my memory of it here among the books.&rdquo;
To one who is possessed of a real love for
books, it is a simple task to forget all else in
a room where there are thousands of them. So
completely did Florence forget that she soon
lost all consciousness of the role she was playing,
and when a rough looking man with a seafaring
roll to his walk came marching toward
her she could do nothing but stare at him. And
when he said, &ldquo;Howdy Meg,&rdquo; she only stared
the harder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The train leaves at eleven thirty,&rdquo; he said,
twisting his well worn cap in his nervous fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated. Then of a
sudden the words of the girl came back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! All right,&rdquo; she said in as steady a
tone as she could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;Oh, all right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right it is, then,&rdquo; he said and, turning about,
disappeared behind a pile of books.</p>
<p>With her head in a whirl, the girl stood and
stared after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train leaves at eleven thirty,&rdquo; she whispered.
It was a few minutes past ten now.
Should she go and tell the girl? She had not
been instructed in this regard. What sort of
an affair was this she was getting into, anyway?
Was this girl hiding from her people, attempting
to run away? The man had looked rough
enough, but he had looked honest, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>She had wandered about the place in uncertainty
for another half hour. Then a kindly
faced women, in a sort of uniform and a strange
hat with gold lettered &ldquo;Seaman&rsquo;s Rest&rdquo; on its
band, accosted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Meg!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You still
here? The train leaves at eleven-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There it was again. This time she did not
forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! All right!&rdquo; she exclaimed and turning
hurried away as if to make a train.</p>
<p>An hour later, still very much puzzled and not
a little worried, she returned to the locker room,
took off the borrowed clothes, gave the wonderful
fox fur a loving pat, deposited it with the
coat and hat, then locked the door.</p>
<p>After that she went to her own locker, put on
her wraps preparatory to going to lunch, then
walked over to the elevator.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s wait brought her car to her.
The other girl was still operating skillfully.
Florence pressed the locker key into the girl&rsquo;s
hand and stepped to the back of the car. Five
minutes later she found herself in the crisp air
of a midwinter day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; she whispered to herself,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;d do that for a total stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she ate her lunch a resolve, one of the
strongest she had ever made, formed itself in
her mind. She would become acquainted with
her mysterious double and would learn her
secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train leaves at eleven-thirty,&rdquo; she mused.
&ldquo;Well, wherever it might have been going, it&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo; She glanced at the clock which read
twelve-fifteen.</p>
<p>And then, of a sudden, all thought of the
other girl and her affairs was blotted out by a
resolve she had made that very morning. This
was Friday. Day after to-morrow was Christmas.
She wanted a surprise on Christmas.
She had started to tell Lucile about it that morning,
but while just in the middle of the story the
elevator had reached the Book Department and
Lucile had hurried away. Soon after came the
strange experience of meeting her double and
Florence had quite forgotten all about it until
this very minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to provide my own surprise,&rdquo; she said
to herself, while thinking it through. &ldquo;But
how am I to surprise myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This had taken a great deal of thinking, but
in the end she hit upon the very thing. Her
old travelling bag had gone completely to pieces
on her last trip. Her father had sent her
fifteen dollars for the purchase of a new one.
She had the money still. She would buy a
travelling bag with a surprise in it.</p>
<p>Only a few days before, a friend had told her
how this might be done. Every great hotel has
in its store room a great deal of baggage which
no one claims; such as hat boxes, trunks, bags
and bundles. Someone leaves his baggage as
security for a bill. He does not return. Someone
leaves his trunk in storage. He too disappears.
Someone dies. In time all this baggage
is sold at an auctioneer&rsquo;s place to the highest
bidders. They have all been sealed when
placed in the store room, and here they are,
trunks, bundles and bags, all to be sold with
&ldquo;contents if any.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;With contents if any.&rdquo; Florence had read
that sentence over many times as she finished
scanning the notice of an auction that was to be
held that very afternoon and night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With contents if any,&rdquo; that was where her
surprise was to come in. She would pick out a
good bag that had a woman&rsquo;s name on it, or
one that at least looked as if a woman had
owned it, and she would bid it in. Then the bag
would be hers, and the &ldquo;contents if any.&rdquo; She
thrilled at the thought. Her friend had told
of diamond rings, of gold watches, of a string
of pearls, of silks and satins and silver jewel
boxes that had come from these mysterious
sealed bags and trunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Florence assured herself, &ldquo;there
won&rsquo;t be anything like that in my bag, but anyway
there&rsquo;ll be a surprise. What fun it will
be, on my birthday, to turn the key to the bag
and to peep inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know the afternoon is going to drag terribly.
I do wish I could go now,&rdquo; she sighed,
&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t. I do hope they don&rsquo;t sell all the
nice bags before I get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this she rose from the table, paid her
check and went back to her elevator, still wondering
about her mysterious double and still
dreaming of her birthday surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />CORDIE&rsquo;S STRANGE RIDE</h2>
<p>Twice a day, after Cordie had discovered him,
the police horse, Dick, had a lump of sugar&mdash;one
in the morning and another at noon. And
Mounted Officer Patrick O&rsquo;Hara, very young,
quite handsome and somewhat dashing, received
a smile with each lump of sugar. It would have
been hard to tell which enjoyed his portion the
most, Dick or Patrick O&rsquo;Hara.</p>
<p>Apparently nothing could have pleased Cordie
more than this discovery of an old friend. Yes,
there was one other thing that would have
pleased her much more. She found herself
longing for it more and more. Every time she
saw the horse she secretly yearned for this
privilege.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>And then, quite surprisingly, the opportunity
came. It was noon. Having come out from
the store to give Dick his daily portion, she was
surprised to find him standing alone, head down,
and patiently waiting. A glance down the street
told her there had been an auto collision in the
middle of the block; not a serious one probably,
as the cars did not seem badly smashed, but
of course Patrick O&rsquo;Hara had gone over there
to take down the numbers. Since traffic had
been jammed, he had dismounted and walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what a chance,&rdquo; Cordie breathed,
her heart skipping a beat. &ldquo;Do I dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at the splendid saddle with its
broad circle of brass and other trappings. She
studied Dick&rsquo;s smooth, sleek sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;but
I do so want to. Dick, do you suppose he&rsquo;d
care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temptation was growing stronger. Glancing
down the street, she caught a glimpse of
Patrick O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s cap above the crowd. His
back was turned. The temptation was no longer
to be resisted. With a touch and a spring, light
as air, Cordie leaped into the saddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just for old times,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>She had meant to hover there for an instant,
then to leap right down again. But alas for
the best laid plans. Old Dick had apparently
remembered things about the past which she
had quite forgotten, and with a wild snort his
head went up, his four feet came together, and
with a leap that completely cleared him from the
autos that blocked his way, he went tearing
down the street.</p>
<p>For a second the girl&rsquo;s head was in a whirl.
So unexpected was this mad dash that she was
all but thrown from the saddle. Apparently an
experienced rider, she regained her balance,
clung to the pommel of the saddle for an instant,
then gripping the reins, she screamed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, Dick! Whoa! Whoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had her scream been &ldquo;Go Dick! Go!&rdquo; it
would not have had a different effect. He
simply redoubled his speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Then it was that the State Street throng of
shoppers viewed a performance that was not on
the program and one they would not soon forget&mdash;a
hatless, coatless girl, hair flying, cheeks
aflame, dashing madly down the street astride
a sturdy police horse.</p>
<p>Some laughed, some cheered, others gasped
in astonishment and fright. A corner policeman
leaped for the reins, but missed. Panic spread
through the cross streets. It was a bad morning
for jay-walkers. Having failed to see the on-coming
charger, they would leap boldly before
a slow-moving auto to give one startled look
upward, then to register the blankest surprise
and shy suddenly backward. Had it not been
such a serious business, Cordie would have
laughed at the expressions on their faces; but
this was no laughing matter. To all appearances
she had stolen a policeman&rsquo;s horse, and
that in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Suddenly a second police horse swung out into
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop! I arrest you!&rdquo; shouted the
rider.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy said,&rdquo; the girl murmured in an
agony of fear lest Dick should trample someone
under his feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy said. I wish you
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently Dick did not agree with these sentiments,
for the instant he sensed this rival his
head went higher, a great snort escaped his
nostrils and he was away with a fresh burst of
speed which left the surprised officer three
lengths behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh! What shall I do!&rdquo; groaned the
girl.</p>
<p>The more she tugged at the reins the faster
flew Dick&rsquo;s splendid limbs. He had the bit between
his teeth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if aggravated by the crowds that
threatened to block his way, he whirled to a
side street and went dashing toward the Boulevard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Boulevard! Oh, the Boulevard! We
will be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before them lay the Boulevard where autos,
thick as bees in clover, raced forward at twenty
miles an hour. What chance could there be of
escape?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Trust a horse. While pedestrians stared and
screamed in terror, while policemen vainly blew
whistles and auto drivers set brakes screaming,
Dick, without slackening his pace, raced ahead
of a yellow limousine, grazed a black sedan,
sent a flivver to the curb, and with one magnificent
leap cleared the sidewalk and the low
chain at its edge, landing squarely upon the soft,
yielding turf of the park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; he all but seemed to say.
Then, heading south along the narrow park
that extended straight away for a mile, he continued
his mad career.</p>
<p>Cordie, risking one backward look, gasped in
consternation and fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, Dick, you old villain! You&rsquo;ve got me
in for life! Never, never again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three policemen, each mounted on his steed,
came dashing after her in mad pursuit.</p>
<p>A straight, broad course lay before them; a
pretty enough course to tempt anyone. Seeming
to gain new strength from the very touch of
it, Dick gripped his bit and fairly flew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>And Cordie, in spite of her predicament, regardless
of impending arrest, was actually getting
a thrill out of it. For one thing, there were
now no pedestrians to be run down. The park
was deserted. For another thing, ahead of Dick
lay a clear stretch of turf which she hoped
would satisfy his lust for speed.</p>
<p>Finding herself in a more cheerful frame of
mind, Cordie took to studying her pursuers.
That they were of different ages she guessed
more by the way they rode than by a clear
view of their faces; Dick had left them too far
behind for that. The foremost rider was a man
of thirty-five or so, a stern minion of the law,
and he was plainly angry. It had been he who
had informed her on State Street that she was
arrested. He had an unusually long nose&mdash;she
remembered that. He rode a poor mount very
badly indeed. The punishment he was getting,
as he jounced up and down in the saddle, he
would doubtless attempt to pass on to her and
to Dick. She ardently wished that he might
never catch up, but realized at the same time
that it could not well be avoided. The race
must come to a close.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The other policemen were different. One was
heavy and well past middle age; the other young,
perhaps no older than Patrick O&rsquo;Hara. They
rode with the easy grace of an aged and a
young cowboy. She had seen some like that in
the movies not so long ago. She fancied she
saw a smile on the younger man&rsquo;s face. Perhaps
he was enjoying the race. She sincerely
hoped he might be, and the older man, too. As
for the one of the long nose&mdash;not a chance.</p>
<p>All things have an end. Dick&rsquo;s race did.
Having come close to an iron fence, beyond
which towered a brick structure, he appeared
to assume that he had reached the goal. Dropping
to a slow trot, he circled gracefully to the
right, and as he came to a standstill he threw
his head high as much as to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won, didn&rsquo;t we; and by a handsome
margin!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you old goose,&rdquo; the girl breathed.
&ldquo;And now, instead of a blue ribbon for you and
a purse for me, we get an invite to some dirty
old police court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time for further thought. The
foremost policeman, he of the long nose, rode
up and snatching at the reins, snarled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you call that smart, you&mdash;you
flapper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staring angrily at the girl, he gave Dick&rsquo;s
rein such a yank as threw the magnificent horse
on his haunches.</p>
<p>Instantly Cordie&rsquo;s eyes flashed fire. They
might take her to jail and welcome; but abuse
Dick he might not!</p>
<p>Dick, however, proved quite equal to caring
for himself. With a snort he leaped to one side,
and jerking his rein from the policeman&rsquo;s grasp,
went dashing away.</p>
<p>So sudden was this turn that Cordie, caught
unawares, was thrown crashing to the ground.
The officer wheeled and rode after the horse.</p>
<p>It was the older man, the one with gray about
his temples, who, quickly dismounting, helped
the girl to her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; he asked in a tone that had
a fatherly touch in it.</p>
<p>That did the trick for Cordie. All her anger
was gone. She was not injured, but tears came
trickling out from beneath her eyelids as she
half sobbed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry. Truly I am. I didn&rsquo;t, didn&rsquo;t
mean to. Truly&mdash;truly I didn&rsquo;t! I&mdash;I used
to ride him in races, on&mdash;on the farm. And
I thought&mdash;thought it would be fun to just
sit&mdash;sit a minute in his saddle. I tried it and
I guess&mdash;guess he thought it was to be another
race. Anyway, he&mdash;he bolted with me and I
couldn&rsquo;t stop him. Truly, truly I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Miss,&rdquo; said the elderly one,
putting a fatherly hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;It
may not be so bad, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger policeman had also dismounted
and now stood smiling at them and appearing to
wish he might take the place of his older friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Pat O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; he said at last.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the smartest mount on the force. And
I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, if we wait for Hogan to
catch him we&rsquo;ll be here until to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Hogan, the irate policeman, was certainly having
his troubles catching Dick. With the skill
and mischief of a trained performer, Dick was
playing tag with him in a masterly fashion. He
would stand with head down as if asleep until
his pursuer was all but upon him; then with a
snort he would dash away. No amount of coaxing,
cajoling or cursing could bring him any
nearer to capture.</p>
<p>This little play went on for several minutes.
Then, at a time when Dick had circled quite
close to her, Cordie suddenly put two fingers to
her lips and let out a shrill whistle. Instantly
the splendid horse pricked up his ears and came
trotting toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Dick,&rdquo; she whispered, patting him
on the neck and not so much as putting out a
hand for his rein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; mumbled the younger
policeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots like &rsquo;em, both horses and girls,&rdquo;
the old man smiled, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll swear there&rsquo;s not
more bad in the girl than the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, now Hogan,&rdquo; he held up a warning
hand to the one who came riding up. &ldquo;You
leave this to me. Where&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;State and Madison,&rdquo; volunteered the younger
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, we&rsquo;re off. You men can ride back
to your posts. I&rsquo;ll tend to this matter myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man grinned. Hogan growled;
then they rode away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better mount and ride back,&rdquo; suggested
the older man to Cordie.</p>
<p>Seeing her hesitate, he reached for her rein,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll steady him a bit, but he&rsquo;s had his race.
Guess he&rsquo;ll be satisfied. But,&rdquo; he said suddenly,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not dressed for this. You must be
half frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unstrapping a great coat from Patrick
O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s saddle, he helped her into it and together
they rode away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>And so it happened that on this day, only a
few days before Christmas, the throngs along
State Street viewed a second unusual sight.
Though quite different from the first, it was no
less mystifying. Who ever heard of a gray
haired policeman and a bobbed haired girl in a
policeman&rsquo;s great coat, riding police horses and
parading up the city&rsquo;s most congested street in
broad daylight?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; the girl whispered
to herself as she hid her face from a camera.
&ldquo;It will all be in the papers. And then what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found young Patrick O&rsquo;Hara nervously
pacing his beat on foot. His face lit up with
a broad grin as he saw them approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sort of figured,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;that whoever
took Dick would bring him back. Can&rsquo;t
anybody do a good job of riding him except me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think that,&rdquo; exclaimed Tim Reilly,
the elderly policeman, &ldquo;you just take any horse
on the force, give this girl and Dick a three-length
start, and see if you&rsquo;d catch &rsquo;em. You
would&mdash;not! Not in a thousand moons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patrick O&rsquo;Hara grinned as he helped the
girl down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you beat it,&rdquo; said Tim in as stern a
voice as he could command. &ldquo;I suspect you work
around here somewhere close. You&rsquo;ve overdone
your noon hour, and this the rush season.
You&rsquo;ll be in for it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordie threw him one uncertain glance to discover
whether or not he was in earnest. The
next moment she went racing across the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />AS SEEN FROM THE STAIRWAY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world have you been?&rdquo; Lucile
exclaimed, pouncing upon Cordie as soon as she
came in sight. &ldquo;Rennie&rsquo;s been worrying her
poor old head off about you, and Miss Mones,
who&rsquo;s in charge of the checking girls, is
furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Cordie drawled, &ldquo;I was out to lunch.
Then I took a spin down the park on my favorite
steed. It&rsquo;s a won-der-ful day outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a lot of time to spend outside,&rdquo;
scolded Lucile, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t get right back to
your stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, having somehow made her
peace with Miss Mones, Cordie was back at her
task, rustling paper and snipping cord.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Late that afternoon Lucile was sent to the
twelfth floor storeroom to look up a special
order. She enjoyed these trips to the upper
realms. This vast storeroom was like a new
world to her. As she walked down long, narrow,
silent aisles, on either side of which were
wired in compartments piled high with every
conceivable form of merchandise: rugs, piano
lamps, dolls, dishes, couches, clothes-pins, and
who knows what others, she could not help feeling
that she was in the store house of the world,
that she was queen of this little ward and that
there remained only for her to say the word
and a house would be handsomely furnished, a
beautiful bride outfitted with a trousseau, or a
Christmas tree decorated for a score of happy
children. Yes, these aisles held a charm and
fascination all their own. She liked the silence
of the place, too. After the hours of listening
to the constant babble of voices, the murmur of
shoppers, the call of clerks, the answers of floormen,
this place seemed the heart of silent woods
at night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Captivated by such thoughts as these, and
having located the missing books and started
them on their journey down the elevator, she
decided to walk down the nine flights to her
own floor.</p>
<p>Here, too, as she skipped lightly down from
floor to floor, she caught little intimate glimpses
of the various lives that were being lived in this
little world of which she was for a time a part.
Here a score of printing presses and box making
machines were cutting, shaping and printing
containers for all manner of holiday goods. The
constant rush of wheels, the press and thump
of things, the wrinkles on the brows of operators,
all told at what a feverish heat the work was
being pushed forward.</p>
<p>One floor lower down the same feverish pace
was being set. Here nimble fingers dipped and
packed chocolate bon-bons, while from the right
and left of them came the rattle and thump of
drums polishing jelly beans and moulding gum
drops at the rate of ten thousand a minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Ah yes, there was the Christmas rush for
you. But one floor lower down there was quiet
and composure such as one might hope to find
in a meadow where a single artist, with easel
set, sketches a landscape. It was not unlike that
either, for the two-score of persons engaged
here were sketching, too. The sketches they
made with pen and ink and water-colors were
not unattractive. Drawings of house interiors
they were; here the heavily furnished office of
some money king, and there the light and airy
boudoir of one of society&rsquo;s queens; here the
modest compartment of a young architect who,
though of only average means, enjoyed having
things done right, and there the many roomed
mansion of a steel magnate. These sketches
were made and then shown to the prospective
customer. The customer offered suggestions,
made slight changes, then nodded, wrote a check,
and a sale amounting to thousands of dollars was
completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be fascinating work,&rdquo; Lucile
whispered to herself as an artistic looking young
woman showed a finished sketch to a customer.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d like that. I believe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>With a sudden shock her thoughts were cut
short. Two persons had entered the glassed-in
compartment&mdash;a woman of thirty and a girl
in her late teens. And of all persons!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mystery Lady and Cordie! It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo;
she breathed, &ldquo;and yet it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, too. None other. What was stranger
still, they appeared to have business here. At
sight of them one of the artists arose and lifting
a drawing which had been standing face to
the wall, held it out for their inspection.</p>
<p>Cordie clasped her hands in very evident
ecstasy of delight, and, if Lucile read her lips
aright, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfectly wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression on the Mystery Lady&rsquo;s face
said plainer than words, &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sketch, Lucile could see plainly enough
from where she stood, was a girl&rsquo;s room. There
was a bed with draperies, a study table of
slender-legged mahogany, a dresser, one great
comfortable chair surprisingly like Lucile&rsquo;s own,
some simpler chairs of exquisite design. These
furnishings, and such others as only a girl
would love, were done in the gay tints that appeal
to the springtime of youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cordie?&rdquo; Lucile stared incredulously. &ldquo;A
simple country girl, what can she know about
such things? That room&mdash;why those furnishings
would cost hundreds of dollars. It&rsquo;s absurd,
impossible; and yet there they are&mdash;she and the
Mystery Lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mystery Lady! At thought of her,
Lucile was seized with an almost uncontrollable
desire to rush down there and demand the meaning
of that lady&rsquo;s many strange doings. But
something held her back. So Cordie was acquainted
with the Mystery Lady! Here was
something strange. Indeed, Lucile was beginning
to wonder a great deal about Cordie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has her secrets, little Cordie!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lucile. &ldquo;Who would have thought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it is not strange that Lucile did not
feel warranted in breaking in upon those secrets.
So there she stood, irresolute, until the two of
them had left the room and lost themselves in
the throngs that crowded every aisle of this
great mart of trade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Lucile sighed, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t ever feel
quite the same about Cordie. I suppose, though,
she has a right to her secrets. What could she
possibly know about interior decorating and furnishing?
Perhaps more than I would guess.
But a country girl? What does she know about
the Mystery Lady? Little, or much? Have
they known each other long? I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ask her.
No&mdash;n-o-o, I guess I won&rsquo;t. I wasn&rsquo;t supposed
to see. It was too much like spying. No,&rdquo; this
decisively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have to let things work
themselves out. And if they don&rsquo;t work out to
something like a revelation, then I&rsquo;ll know they
haven&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all. More than half the mysteries
of the world are never unravelled at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this bit of reasoning, she hastened on
down the remaining flights of stairs to her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Cordie?&rdquo; she asked of Laurie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Out on a shopping pass. Swell looking dame
came in and called for her.&rdquo; There was a
knowing grin on Laurie&rsquo;s face as he said this,
but Lucile, who had turned to her work, did
not notice it.</p>
<p>Cordie returned a few moments later, but not
one word did she let fall regarding her shopping
mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />SILVER GRAY TREASURE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think!&rdquo; exclaimed Cordie. &ldquo;It
was such a strange thing to happen. I just have
to tell some one, or I&rsquo;ll burst. I daren&rsquo;t tell
Lucile. I am afraid she&rsquo;d scold me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James, the mysterious seaman who carried
bundles in the book department, looked at her
and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of stories in my life, and
them that wasn&rsquo;t to be repeated, wasn&rsquo;t. If
you&rsquo;ve got a yarn to file away in the pigeon
holes of somebody&rsquo;s brain, why file it with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had come upon James while on the way
from the cloak room. She would have to wait
a full half hour before Lucile would have finished
her work, and she felt that she just must
tell some one of her thrilling adventure with
Dick and the policeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Seated on the edge of a table, feet dangling
and fingers beating time to the music of her
story, she told James of this thrilling adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came out well enough at that,&rdquo; he
chuckled when she had finished. &ldquo;Lots better&rsquo;n
I did the last time I mixed into things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordie wondered if this remark had reference
to his chase after the hawk-eyed young man
who had followed her to the furnace room that
night. But asking no questions, she just waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny trip, that last sea voyage I took,&rdquo;
James mused at last, his eyes half closed. &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t have been half bad if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for one vile crook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;sometimes of a
summer I run up to Nome. I&rsquo;ve always had a
few hundred dollars, that is up until now. I&rsquo;d
go up there in the north and sort of wander
round on gasoline schooners and river boats,
buyin&rsquo; up skins; red, white, cross fox, and
maybe a silver gray or two. Minks and martin
too, and ermine and Siberian squirrel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Always had a love for real furs; you know
what I mean, the genuine stuff that stands up
straight and fluffy and can&rsquo;t be got anywhere
far south of the Arctic Circle&mdash;things like the
fox skin that&rsquo;s on that cape your pal Lucile
wears sometimes. When I see all these pretty
girls wearin&rsquo; rabbit skin coats, it makes me
feel sort of bad. Why, even the Eskimos do
better than that! They dress their women in
fawn skin; mighty pretty they are, too, sometimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, last summer I went up to Nome,
that&rsquo;s in Alaska, you know, and from there I
took a sort of pirate schooner that ranges up
and down the coast of Alaska and into Russian
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirate,&rdquo; breathed Cordie, but James didn&rsquo;t
hear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We touched at a point or two,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;then went over into Russian waters for
walrus hunting&mdash;ivory and skins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ran into a big herd and filled the boat
up, then touched at East Cape, Siberia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any real Russians there, so
we went up to the native village. Old Nepassok,
the chief, seemed to take a liking to me. He
took me into his storeroom and showed me all
his treasure&mdash;walrus and mastodon ivory,
whale bone, red and white fox skins by the hundred,
and some mink and beaver. Then at last
he pulled out an oily cotton bag from somewhere
far back in the corner and drew out of it&mdash;what
do you think? The most perfect brace of
silver fox skins I have ever seen! Black
beauties, they were, with maybe a white hair for
every square inch. Just enough for contrast.
Know who wears skins like that? Only the very
wealthiest people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there I was looking at them, worth a
king&rsquo;s ransom, and maybe I could buy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you?&rdquo; breathed Cordie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could, and did. It took me four hours.
The chief was a hard nut to crack. He left me
just enough to get back to Chicago, but what
did I care? I had a fortune, one you could
carry in two fair sized overcoat pockets, but a
fortune all the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got to Chicago with them,&rdquo; he leaned forward
impressively, &ldquo;and then a barber&mdash;a
dark faced, hawk-eyed barber&mdash;done me out of
them. Of course he was a crook, just playing
barber. Probably learned the trade in jail.
Anyway he done me for my fortune. Cut my
hair, he did, and somehow got the fox skins out
of my bag. When I got to my hotel all I had
in my bag was a few clothes and a ten dollar
gold piece. I raced back to the barber shop but
he was gone; drawed his pay and skipped, that
quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he finished, allowing his shoulders
to drop into a slouch, &ldquo;is why I&rsquo;m carrying
books here. I have to, or starve. Just what
comes after Christmas I can&rsquo;t guess. It&rsquo;s not
so easy to pick up a job after the holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know&mdash;&rdquo; he sat up straight
and there was a gleam in his eye, &ldquo;do you know
when I saw that barber fellow last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down below the sub-basement of this store,
in the boiler room at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not the one who was following me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same. And I nearly got him, but not
quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t get him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordie hardly knew whether to be sorry or
glad. She hated violence; also she had no love
for that man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not get him,&rdquo; breathed James, &ldquo;but
next time I will, and what I&rsquo;ll say and do for
him will be for both you and me. G&rsquo;night!&rdquo;
He rose abruptly and, shoulders square, gait
steady and strong, he walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you dreaming about?&rdquo; Lucile
asked as she came upon Cordie five minutes
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much, I guess. Thinking through
a story I just heard, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />LUCILE&rsquo;S DREAM</h2>
<p>That evening on the L train Lucile read a
copy of the morning paper, one which she had
carefully saved for a very definite reason. It
was the paper which was exploiting the Lady
of the Christmas Spirit. Lucile always got a
thrill out of reading about the latest doings of
that adventurous person who had managed to
be everywhere, to mingle with great throngs,
and yet to be recognized by no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; she whispered to herself
as a fresh thrill ran through her being.
&ldquo;She was to be in our store this very afternoon;
in the art room of the furniture store. That&rsquo;s
the very room in which I saw Cordie and the
Mystery Lady. This Lady of the Christmas
Spirit may have been in the room at that exact
moment. How very, very exciting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Closing her eyes, she tried to see that room
again; to call back pictures of ladies who had
entered the room while she had been looking
down upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she thought at last, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t one
that fits; one was tall and ugly, one short, stout
and middle aged, and two were quite gray. Not
one fits the description of this Christmas Spirit
person; unless, unless&mdash;&rdquo; her heart skipped a
beat. She had thought of the Mystery Lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course it couldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she reasoned
at last. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t say she was to be there
at that very moment. I was not standing on
the stair more than ten minutes. There are
six such periods in an hour and nine and a
half working hours in a store day. Fine chance!
One chance in fifty. And yet, stranger things
have happened. What if it were she!
What&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her dreamings were broken short off by
the sudden crumpling of paper at her side.
Cordie had been glancing over the evening
paper. Now the paper had entirely disappeared,
and Cordie&rsquo;s face was crimson to the roots of
her hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why Cordie, what&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; exclaimed
Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noth&mdash;nothing&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; said Cordie,
looking suddenly out of the window.</p>
<p>That was all Lucile could get out of her.
One thing seemed strange, however. At the
stand by the foot of the elevated station Cordie
bought two copies of the same paper she had
been reading on the train. These she folded up
into a solid bundle and packed tightly under
her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why she did that?&rdquo; Lucile thought
to herself.</p>
<p>As often happens in bachelor ladies&rsquo; apartments,
this night there was nothing to be
found in their larder save sugar, milk and
cocoa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get the cocoa to a boil,&rdquo; said Lucile,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll run over to the delicatessen for something
hot. I&rsquo;m really hungry to-night.&rdquo; She
was down the stairs and away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Somewhat to her annoyance, she found the
delicatessen packed with students waiting their
turn to be supplied with eatables. The term had
ended, and those who were too far from home
to take the holidays away from the University
were boarding themselves.</p>
<p>After sinking rather wearily into a corner
seat, Lucile found her mind slipping back over
the days that had just flown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she told herself soberly, &ldquo;is
the day before Christmas. It is my last day at
the store. And then? Oh, bother the &lsquo;and
then&rsquo;! There&rsquo;s always a future, and always it
comes out somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she might not be depressed by thoughts
of the low state of her finances, she filled her
mind with day dreams. In these dreams she
saw herself insisting that Cordie reveal to her
the secret hiding place of the Mystery Lady.
Having searched this lady out, she demanded
the return of her well worn, but comfortable,
coat. In the dream still she saw the lady throw
up her hands to exclaim:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That frayed thing? I gave it to the rag
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in a rage she, Lucile, stamps her foot
and says: &ldquo;How could you! Of course now
I shall keep your cape of fox skin and Siberian
squirrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that was a beautiful
dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing up, she saw there were still six
customers ahead of her and she must wait for
her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for another,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>This time it was the Lady of the Christmas
Spirit. She saw her among the throngs at the
store. Feeling sure that this must be the very
person, that she might steal a look at her hands,
she followed her from department to department.
Upstairs and downstairs they went.
More than once she caught the lady throwing
back a mocking glance at her.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, at the ribbon counter she
caught sight of her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such hands!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;There
never were others like them. It is the Lady of
the Christmas Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting out her own hand, she grasped one
of the marvelous ones as she whispered: &ldquo;You
are the Lady of the Christmas Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once there came a mighty jingle of gold.
A perfect shower of gold went sparkling and
tinkling to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&mdash;Oh! It will all be lost!&rdquo; she
cried, leaping forward.</p>
<p>She leaped almost into the delicatessen keeper&rsquo;s
arms. To her surprise she saw that the store
was empty. Her day-dream had ended in a
real dream; she had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Hastily collecting her scattered senses, she
selected a steaming pot of beans and a generous
cylinder of brown bread, then drawing her scarf
about her, dashed out into the night.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />THE NEWSPAPER PICTURE</h2>
<p>Lucile may have been dreaming, but Cordie
was wide awake and thinking hard. The instant
Lucile had closed the door behind her she had
spread one of the papers she had bought out
before her and, having opened it at page 3, sat
down to look at a picture reproduced there.</p>
<p>For a full two minutes she sat staring at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well anyway, it&rsquo;s not such a bad picture,&rdquo;
she chuckled at last.</p>
<p>After the chuckle her face took on a sober
look.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she exclaimed: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see
what they say about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well of all things! Nothing but a line of
question marks! Well, at least the reporters
know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>For a moment she stared at the long line of
interrogation points, then her face dimpled with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;They never
whispered one word! Not one of them all!
Not Patrick O&rsquo;Hara, nor the old one they called
Tim, nor the young one, nor even Hogan, who
was so angry at me. And I&rsquo;ll bet the reporters
begged and tempted them in every way they
could think of. What wonderful good sports
policemen must be. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to hug every
one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she went skipping across the floor and
back again, then paused and stared again at the
picture.</p>
<p>Truth was, all unknown to her, and certainly
very much against her wishes, Cordie&rsquo;s picture
had gotten into the paper. This was the picture
she was still staring at: Crowds thronging
State Street, a gray-haired mounted policeman,
and by his side, also riding a police horse, a
bobbed haired young girl in a policeman&rsquo;s great
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they see it!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me stay. They will see it
too&mdash;of course they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, what does it matter?&rdquo; she exclaimed
a moment later. &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s the day
before Christmas. What will I care after
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing steps on the stairs, she hastily tore
a page out of each of the two papers, folded
them carefully and thrust them into a drawer.
Then she threw the remaining part of the paper
into the waste basket.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;To-morrow is the day before Christmas,&rdquo;
whispered Lucile as two hours later she sat
staring rather moodily at the figures in the
worn carpet. &ldquo;A great Christmas, I suppose,
for some people. Doesn&rsquo;t look like it would be
much for me. With term bills and room rent
staring me in the face, and only a few dollars
for paying them, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t look good.
And here I am with this little pet of mine sleeping
on me and eating on me, and apparently
no honest way of getting rid of her.&rdquo; She shook
her finger at the bed where Cordie was sleeping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only you were an angora cat,&rdquo; she chided,
still looking at the dreaming girl, &ldquo;I might sell
you. Even a canary would be better&mdash;he&rsquo;d
make no extra room rent and he&rsquo;d eat very
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;am I sorry? I
should say I&rsquo;m not! It&rsquo;s a long, long life, and
somehow we&rsquo;ll struggle through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; she mused again. &ldquo;It will be
a great Christmas for some people, be a wonderful
one for Jefrey Farnsworth&mdash;that is, it
will be if he&rsquo;s still alive. I wonder when they&rsquo;ll
find him, and where? They say we&rsquo;ve sold two
thousand of his books this season. Think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>After that she sat wondering in a vague and
dreamy way about many things. Printed pages
relating to the Lady of the Christmas Spirit
floated before her mind&rsquo;s vision to be followed
by a picture of Cordie and the Mystery Lady in
the art room of the furnishings department.
Cordie&rsquo;s iron ring, set with a diamond, glimmered
on the strange, long, muscular fingers of
a hand. Laurie sold the last copy of &ldquo;Blue
Flames.&rdquo; Jefrey Farnsworth, in the manner she
had always pictured him, tall, dark, with deep-set
eyes and a stern face wrinkled by much
mental labor, stood before an audience of women
and made a speech. Yellow gold glittered, then
spread out like a molten stream. With a start
she shook herself into wakefulness. Once more
she had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; she whispered as she crept into
bed. &ldquo;To-morrow is the day before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />&ldquo;WITH CONTENTS, IF ANY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In the meantime Florence had come upon an
adventure. The place she entered a half hour
after quitting time was a great barn-like room
where dark shadows lurked in every corner but
one. The huge stacks of bags and trunks that
loomed up indistinctly in those dark corners
made the place seem the baggage room of some
terminal railway depot.</p>
<p>As she joined the throng in the one light
corner of the room she was treated to another
little thrill. Such a motley throng as it was.
Jewish second-hand dealers, short ones, tall ones,
long-bearded ones; men of all races. And there
were two or three women, and not a few vagabonds
of the street, who had come in for no
other purpose than to get out of the cold. Such
were those who crowded round the high stand
where, with gavel in hand, the auctioneer cried
the sale:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much am I bid? Ten dollars! Thank
you. Ten I have. Who&rsquo;ll make it eleven!
&rsquo;Leven, &rsquo;leven, &rsquo;leven. Who&rsquo;ll make it twelve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not an attractive face in the group
that surrounded the block. Florence was
tempted to run away; but recalling the surprise
she had promised herself, she stayed.</p>
<p>Presently her eyes fell upon a face that attracted
her, the kindly, gentle face of a woman
in her thirties. She was seated at a desk,
writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the clerk of the sale,&rdquo; Florence
thought. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re selling trunks now. She
may be able to tell me when they will sell bags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved over close to the desk and timidly
put her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really want one of those bags?&rdquo;
the woman asked, surprise showing in her
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Why not?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No reason at all, I guess,&rdquo; said the clerk.
Then, after looking at Florence for a moment,
a comradely smile spread over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up close,&rdquo; she beckoned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
selling bags in fifteen minutes or so,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Sit down here and wait. Why do
you want one of those bags so badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I need one,&rdquo; said Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not&mdash;not all,&rdquo; Florence hesitated,
then told her frankly of the surprise she had
planned for herself.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s face became almost motherly
as she finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;There are just five bags to be sold in the next
lot. You won&rsquo;t want the first one. She&mdash;the
woman who owned it, died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Florence whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get the second nor the third.
That long bearded Jew, and the slim, dark man
standing by the post, will run them high if they
have to. They know something about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did they find out? I don&rsquo;t know, but
they did. The last two bags are quite good
ones, good as you would purchase new for fifteen
or twenty dollars, and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo;
she winked an eye ever so slightly, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder a bit if there&rsquo;d be a real surprise in
one of them for you. There now, dearie,&rdquo; she
smiled, &ldquo;run over and look at them, over there
beside the green trunk. And don&rsquo;t whisper a
word of what I have told you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one nearest the block will be sold first,
and the others just as they come,&rdquo; she added
as the girl rose to go.</p>
<p>Making her way around the outskirts of the
crowd, Florence walked over to the place of
the green trunk. The bags were all good, and
most of them nearly new. Any one of them,
she concluded, would see her safely through
college, and that was all that mattered. Then,
lest she attract too much attention, she slunk
away into a dark corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Her heart skipped a beat when the first bag
was put up. Her hopes fell when she saw it
sell for thirty-two dollars. Her little roll of
fifteen dollars seemed to grow exceedingly small
as she clutched it in her right hand. Was her
dream of a surprise for Christmas morning only
a dream? It would seem so, for the second and
third bags also sold for a high figure. But, recalling
the little lady&rsquo;s advice, she kept up her
courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much am I bid?&rdquo; said the auctioneer
as the fourth bag was handed him. Florence
caught her breath. She tried to say &ldquo;Ten dollars,&rdquo;
but her tongue stuck to the roof of her
mouth. A round faced man relieved her of
the task. The bag went to eleven dollars, then
twelve. Then it came to a halt, giving time
for Florence to regain her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve and a half,&rdquo; her voice seemed piping
and thin in that great place. But the auctioneer
got it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Twelve and a half, a half, a
half.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen! Thank you. Thirteen I have.
Now the half,&rdquo; he nodded to Florence and she
nodded back, &ldquo;And a half, I have it. And a
half. Now fourteen. Thirteen and a half.
Now make it fourteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen,&rdquo; someone shouted. Again the
girl&rsquo;s heart sank. What was the use?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a half?&rdquo; The auctioneer nodded at
her and she nodded back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now fifteen. Now fifteen. Now fifteen,&rdquo;
he shouted hoarsely. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll make it fifteen?
Fifteen once. Fifteen twice!&rdquo; Florence crushed
her money into a solid mass, &ldquo;Fifteen three
times, and SOLD to the young lady in blue!&rdquo;
His gavel came down with a bang.</p>
<p>Scarcely believing her senses, the girl groped
her way forward to receive the bag, then hurried
over to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got it?&rdquo; smiled the clerk. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
hoping it&rsquo;s a beautiful, wonderful surprise!&rdquo;
she whispered as she pressed a lonely half dollar
into the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>Curiosity regarding the price that would be
bid for the last bag of the lot held Florence
to the spot for the space of three minutes. And
that was a bit of curiosity which she was
destined to regret.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>As she stood there listening to the bids she
could not help but notice a dark man, with
burning, hawk-like eyes hurry into the place,
glance frantically about, race back to the place
where the five bags had been, then stand stock
still. His dark eyes roved about the place
until they came to rest on one spot and that
spot was the one occupied by the bag which
Florence held in her hand. From that time
until she left the room, although he pretended
to be looking at everything else, she was sure
his eyes did not leave that bag for a space of
more than five seconds at any one time. The
cold glitter of his eyes made her feel strangely
weak at the knees.</p>
<p>She had not gone twenty rods from the place
when she heard footsteps behind her. Looking
back, she saw that same small dark man coming
behind her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just happened to come out then,&rdquo; she tried
to reassure herself. But it was no use. Something
within her told her that she was being
followed, followed on the deserted city streets
at night.</p>
<p>At once a mad procession of questions began
racing through her mind. Who was this man?
Was it the bag he wanted? Why? What did
he know about the bag? What did it really
contain? To none of these questions could she
form an adequate answer. Only one thing stood
out clearly in her mind&mdash;the bag was hers. She
had come by it in an honest manner. The
hotel had a right to give it to the auctioneer
to sell. She had a right to purchase it. She
had paid for it. She had the bill of sale. It
was rightfully hers.</p>
<p>But even as these thoughts crystallized in her
mind she realized that she was desperately
afraid. The man with his burning black eyes
was enough to inspire fear, and added to that
it was night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;The
elevated station is only two blocks ahead, but
he will board the train I take. He will follow
me after I get off and there are five desolate
blocks to travel to my room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Suddenly a solution came to her. Just before
her was the entrance to the LaSalle Street
Railway Station. Why not walk in there and
leave the bag at the checking room? She could
return for it in the morning and carry it to
the store where she could check it again and
leave it until closing time.</p>
<p>No sooner thought than done. Five minutes
later, looking neither to right nor left, she
walked demurely out of the station. She did
not know what had become of her pursuer, and
she did not care. The bag was safe. He could
not get it, and aside from that, what did he
care for her, an elevator girl going home from
work? Very evidently he cared nothing at all,
for she did not see him again that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fooled him,&rdquo; she smiled to herself as she
settled herself comfortably in a seat where she
might watch the winter whitened city speed
past her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last I&rsquo;ll ever see of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>In coming to this conclusion she overlooked
one trifling detail. Since the night was cold,
she had worn beneath her coat her elevator
girl&rsquo;s uniform. The auction room was warm.
While there she had unbuttoned her coat, displaying
plainly the uniform and the monogrammed
buttons on it. The greatest of stores
employ few enough elevator girls. To visit each
bank of elevators and to get a look at each girl
is but the work of an hour or two at most.
The man would have no trouble in locating her
if he cared to do so. Since she had not thought
of this she rode home humming in a carefree
manner and, after a meal of sandwiches, cocoa
and pie, followed by an hour of reading, she
went to bed to dream of mysterious treasures
taken by the truck load from the depths of a
heavy, dark brown travelling bag.</p>
<p>She awoke in the morning with a pleasing
sense of mystery and anticipation lurking about
in the shadowy corners of her brain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Leaping from bed, she went through a series
of wild calesthenics which set every ounce of
blood in her veins racing away with new life.</p>
<p>An hour later, with a little suppressed feeling
of excitement tugging at her heart and
with fingers that trembled slightly, she passed
her check over the counter at the depot. She
had some slight feeling that it had all been a
dream. But no, there it was, her mysterious
bag, as big and handsome as ever. It was quite
light, but she felt sure it was not empty. What
could it contain? She was tempted to draw
the key from her pocket then and there and
have a peek. But no&mdash;to-morrow was Christmas.
She could wait. So, seizing the bag,
she hurried away to her work.</p>
<p>Once the bag was checked at the store and
she back at her lever in the cage that went up
and down, up and down all day, she found herself
thinking of that other girl, the mysterious
double of hers. Where was she to-day? Had
she really gone to work, or had she vanished?
What manner of plot had she been mixed up
in? What train had gone at eleven-thirty?
Whose train? Was that girl supposed to go?
If so, why did she not wish to go? Where
did she live? Who was she anyway?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>While the elevator went up and down, up
and down, these questions, and a score of others,
kept revolving themselves in her mind. At last
she found herself forming a firm resolve that
should she happen upon her mysterious double
again she most certainly would keep in touch
with her until she found out more about her.</p>
<p>She saw her mysterious double shortly after
she had gone to work, but under conditions
which gave her no opportunity to either study
or question her. The girl, dressed in her uniform
and apparently ready to go to work, was
standing before the bank of elevators on the
thirteenth floor. She had been talking in low
and excited tones to a tall, square shouldered
man who, in spite of the fact that he was on
a floor of this great store where only employees
are allowed, had in his bearing and walk
something that spoke strongly of boats and
the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a captain or a mate or something,&rdquo;
Florence said to herself as she sent her
cage speeding downward. &ldquo;I wonder if that
girl belongs to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />A GREAT DAY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The day before Christmas! Oh joy! Joy!
Joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile leaped out of bed. Throwing off her
dream-robe, she went whirling about the room
for all the world as if she were playing roll
the hoop and she were the hoop.</p>
<p>The day before Christmas! Who cared if
room rent was due to-night? Who cared if
the school term loomed ahead with little enough
cash in her stocking to smooth its way? Who
cared about anything? It was the day before
Christmas.</p>
<p>This day work would be light. Tommie had
said that. Donnie had said it. Rennie and all
the others of the sales group who stayed from
year to year had said it. What was more, for
this one day, if never again, Lucile had resolved
to wear the magnificent cape of midnight blue
and fox-skin. And at night, when the day was
done, the week ended, the season closed, there
was to be a wonderful party. A party! Oh
joy! A party!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Laurie, the mysterious Laurie Seymour, had
invited them, just they of his corner&mdash;Donnie
and Rennie, Tommie, Cordie and herself.</p>
<p>A grand party it was to be, a supper at
Henrici&rsquo;s and after that Laurie was to take
them to a symphony concert! And to this party
she would wear the midnight blue cape. For
one night, one reckless, joyous night, she would
travel in the height of style. And then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the &lsquo;and then&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s the day
before Christmas!&rdquo; She went through another
series of wild whirls that landed her beneath
the shower.</p>
<p>When at last she was fully dressed for this
last day of work in the book department, Lucile
drew on the cape. Then, having told Cordie
that she would wait for her outside, she went
skipping down the stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>It was one of those crisp, snappy, frosty
mornings of winter that invite you to inhale
deeply of its clear, liquid-like air.</p>
<p>After taking three deep breaths Lucile buried
her radiant face in the warm depths of the fox
skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How gorgeous,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Oh, that
I might own it forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as she said this all the unanswered questions
that grouped themselves about the cape&mdash;its
owner, and the girl&rsquo;s associates at the store&mdash;came
trooping back to puzzle her. Who was
the Mystery Lady? Why had she left the cape
that night? Why did she not return for it
later? How had it happened that she was in
the store that night at two hours before midnight?
Who was Laurie Seymour? Why had
he given the Mystery Lady his pass-out? How
had he spent that night? What had happened
to the vanished author of &ldquo;Blue Flames&rdquo;?
Who was Cordie? Was she really the poor, innocent
little country girl she had thought her?
What was to come of her, once the season had
closed? Who was the &ldquo;Spirit of Christmas&rdquo;?
Had she ever seen her? Who would get the
two hundred in gold? What had she meant
by the crimson trail she left behind? Who was
Sam? Why was Laurie so much afraid to meet
him? Above all, what were the secrets of the
crimson thread and the diamond set iron ring?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Surely here were problems enough to put
wrinkles in any brow. But it was the day before
Christmas, so, as Cordie came dancing
down to a place beside her, Lucile gripped her
arm and led away in a sort of hop-skip-and-jump
that brought them up breathless at the
station.</p>
<p>There was just time to grab a paper before
the train came rattling in. Having secured a
seat, Lucile hid herself behind her paper. A
moment later she was glad for the paper&rsquo;s protection.
Had it not been for the paper she felt
that half the people on the train might have
read her thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>The thing she saw in the Spirit of Christmas
column, which daily told of the doings of the
lady by that name, was such a startling revelation
that she barely escaped a shriek as her
eyes fell on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been wondering,&rdquo; she read in the
column devoted to the lady of the &ldquo;Christmas
Spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;what I have been meaning by the
crimson trail which I have left behind. Perhaps
some of you have guessed the secret. If
this is true, you have made little use of that
knowledge. None of you have found me. Not
one of the hundreds of thousands who have
passed me has paused to grip my hand and to
whisper: &lsquo;You are the Spirit of Christmas.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I will give you some fresh revelations.
It is the day before Christmas. At midnight
to-night Christmas comes. As the clock strikes
that magic hour my wanderings cease. If no
one has claimed my gold by then, no one will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you always that hands ofttimes
express more than a face. This is true of
my hands. They are strange hands. Stranger
still are the rings I wear upon them. For days
now I have worn an iron ring set with a diamond.
Had someone noticed this, read the
secret and whispered: &lsquo;You are the Spirit of
Christmas,&rsquo; not only should my gold have clinked
for him, but the diamond should have been his
as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile caught her breath as she read this.
Here indeed was revelation. Could it be&mdash;There
was more. She read on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the crimson trail I have left behind.
That is very simple. I marvel that people
can be so blind. I have left it everywhere.
It is unusual, very unusual, yet I have left it
everywhere, in hundreds of places, in newsboys&rsquo;
papers, in shopgirls&rsquo; books, in curtains, shades,
and even in people&rsquo;s garments, yet not one has
read the sign. The sign is this: a bit of crimson
thread drawn twice through and tied.
There is a purple strand in the thread. It is
unusual, yet no one has understood; no one has
said &lsquo;You are the Spirit of Christmas&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The crimson thread,&rdquo; Lucile breathed.
&ldquo;Why, then&mdash;then the Mystery Lady and the
Spirit of Christmas Lady are one, and I have
seen her many times. I saw her at two hours
before midnight. I sold her a book. Twice I
saw her talking to Cordie. I followed her upon
the street. Had I but known it I might have
whispered to her: &lsquo;You are the Spirit of
Christmas.&rsquo; Then the gold would have been
mine. Two hundred in gold!&rdquo; she breathed.
&ldquo;Two hundred in gold! And now it is
gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it? Is it quite gone yet? There is
yet this day, the day before Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again her eyes sought the printed page.
And this is what she read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today I shall not appear before sunset.
Early in the evening, and again between the
hours of ten and midnight, I shall be somewhere
on the Boulevard. I shall attend the
Symphony Concert in Opera Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The concert,&rdquo; Lucile murmured with great
joy. &ldquo;We, too, are going there to-night. We
shall be on the Boulevard. There is yet a
chance. And the beauty of it all is I shall
know her the instant I see her. Oh! You
glorious bag of gold, please, please do wait
for me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>As the car rattled on downtown, her blood
cooled and she realized that there was a very
slight hope. With these broad hints thrown out
to them, all those who had been following the
doings of this mysterious lady would be eagerly
on the alert. There may have been some, perhaps
many, who had found the crimson thread
and had marvelled at it. Perhaps, like her, they
had seen the Mystery Lady&rsquo;s face and would
recognize her if they saw her on the Boulevard.
There may have been many who had seen and
marvelled at the diamond set iron ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; Lucile whispered to herself,
&ldquo;there is yet hope. &lsquo;Hope springs eternal&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the downtown station she dismissed the
subject for matters of more immediate importance,
the last great day of sales before
Christmas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Trade until noon was brisk; mostly business
men rushing in for &ldquo;cash and carry.&rdquo; At noon
she arranged to have lunch with her old chum,
the elevator girl and, because it was the day
before Christmas, instead of the crowded employees&rsquo;
lunch room, they chose as their meeting
place the tea room which was patronized
for the most part by customers. Here, in a
secluded corner, they might talk over old times
and relate, with bated breath, the events of the
immediate past and the future.</p>
<p>Enough there was to tell, too. Lucile&rsquo;s
Mystery Lady, who had turned so suddenly into
the one of the Christmas Spirit, her Laurie
Seymour, her hoped for $200 in gold, her James,
the bundle carrier and last but not least, Cordie.
And for Florence there was her mystifying
double and the bewitching bag that contained
her Christmas surprise. Did ever two girls
have more to tell in one short noon hour?</p>
<p>As Florence finished her story; as she spoke
of seeing her double talking with the broad
shouldered man of the seaman-like bearing,
Lucile suddenly leaned forward to exclaim:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Florence, that man must have been our
bundle carrier, James. He has told Cordie of
his trips upon the sea. There could scarcely be
two such men in one store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be true,&rdquo; smiled Florence, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t forget there are two such persons as I
am in this store. You never can tell. I&rsquo;d as
soon believe he was the same man. Wouldn&rsquo;t
it be thrilling if he should turn out to be a
friend of my double&rsquo;s and we should get all
mixed up in some sort of affair just because
I look exactly like her. Oh, Lucile!&rdquo; she
whispered excitedly, &ldquo;the day isn&rsquo;t done yet!&rdquo;
And indeed it was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this man who followed you after you
had bought the bag,&rdquo; said Lucile thoughtfully.
&ldquo;He sounds an awful lot like the one who tried
to carry Cordie away. Do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re dreaming,&rdquo; laughed Florence
as she reached for her check, then hurried away
to her work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />AN ICY PLUNGE</h2>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s opportunity for following her surprising
double came sooner than she expected;
that very evening, in fact. She had quit work
at the regular time, had donned hat and coat,
had gone to the checking room to retrieve her
Christmas bag. She was just leaving by a side
door when, ahead of her in the throng, she
caught a glimpse of that splendid cross fox
which her double had insisted on her wearing
the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where I
solve a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a thought of what it might lead to,
she followed the girl to a surface car and
boarded it just behind her. At Grand Avenue
the girl got off and Florence followed her
again, boarded an eastbound car and, almost
before she knew it, found herself following the
girl through a blinding swirl of snow that swept
in from the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>The street the girl had taken was covered
with untrodden snow. It led to the Municipal
Pier, the great city pier that like some great
black pointing finger of destiny reached a full
half mile out into the white ice-bound lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where can she be going?&rdquo; Florence
asked herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo! How cold!&rdquo; she shivered.</p>
<p>The next moment she shivered again, but
this time it was from fear. Having chanced to
look about, she was startled to see a man all
but upon her heels. And that man&mdash;no, there
could be no mistake about it&mdash;that man was
the one of the night before, he of the burning
black eyes.</p>
<p>Not knowing what else to do, the girl redoubled
her speed. A half formed hope was
in her mind, a hope that she might catch up
with the other girl. Two were better than
one, even if both were girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Hardly had this hope come when it vanished.
In the shadows of the three-story brick
structure that formed the base of the pier, her
double suddenly disappeared and left her, a lone
girl on a wind-swept, deserted street that led
to an empty pier. And here was a dark-faced,
villainous looking man at her heels.</p>
<p>She could see but one chance now; that she
might find her way out upon the pier and
there, amid its labyrinth of board walks, freight
rooms and deserted lunch rooms, lose herself
from her pursuer. She resolved to try it.
The next moment she dashed into the shadows
of that great black building.</p>
<p>The pier, upon which she had placed hopes
of escape, was used in summer as a recreation
center. On warm days its board walks and its
wind-swept pavilions were thronged. Now it
was still as a tomb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Florence had once been here with the throng,
but had taken little notice of things then. The
very silence of the place was confusing. She
fancied that she heard her own heart beat.
Which way should she turn? Above, two stories
up, she remembered was a broad board walk
a half mile long. She might race up the stairs
to this; but after all it offered no place of
hiding. To her right was a hallway which led
to a long narrow loading place for trucks. At
this place, in summer, ships docked; here their
hundreds of tons of fruit, grain, flour, manufactured
articles, and a hundred other commodities,
were unloaded. She had a vague notion
that just back of this loading place, beyond
the fast closed doors, was a labyrinth of
freight rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only one of those doors were open,&rdquo; she
breathed. &ldquo;Perhaps one is unlocked. It&rsquo;s my
best chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this thinking consumed less than a moment
of time. The next instant she went racing over
the cement floor. She was across it and out
upon the landing in a moment. This she knew
was a perilous position. There was a night
watchman about somewhere. Here she was in
plain view. What would the watchman do if
he found her? Her pursuer was not far behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>With a trembling hand, she gripped the latch
of a door. It lifted, but the door did not open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked,&rdquo; she whispered in a tone of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try another,&rdquo; was her next thought. She
was away like a shot.</p>
<p>Again the latch lifted; again the door refused
to budge. She thought she saw a dark
figure pass from pillar to pillar in the place
she had just left. She could not see him, but
she caught the thud-thud of his feet on the
cement platform.</p>
<p>Fighting her way against the wind, racing
fast, breathing hard, she battled onward. And
all the time something within her was whispering:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, no use, no use.&rdquo; Yet, setting
her teeth hard, she raced on.</p>
<p>The man was gaining, she was sure of that.
Yes, now as she looked back she saw him, only
some fifty yards behind her.</p>
<p>This drove her to frantic effort. But to no
avail. He continued to gain; a yard, two yards,
five, ten, twenty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; she panted sobbingly.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;she could not believe her eyes&mdash;before
her, to the right, was an open door.</p>
<p>Like a flash she was inside. Grasping the
door she attempted to shut it, but the snow
blocked it.</p>
<p>One glance about her showed great dark
bulks on every hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freight,&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;piles of freight.
Here&mdash;here is a chance yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant she was tip-toeing her way
softly in and out among the innumerable piles
of boxes, bags and crates that extended on
and on into the impenetrable darkness.</p>
<p>She ran along as softly as she could, yet each
time as she paused she fancied that she caught
the stealthy footsteps of that horrible man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want? Is it the bag that he
wants? Whose bag was it? Was it his? If
so, why did he let it get away from him?&rdquo;
These questions kept racing through her brain.
Then came another question even more disturbing.
Perhaps this man had been unfortunate,
had been sick or had lost all his property.
It might be that he had returned just
in time to miss the opportunity of redeeming
this lost possession which contained something
he prized, perhaps of great value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case he is more to be pitied than
feared,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>For an instant she contemplated going back
to him; yet she dared not.</p>
<p>So, in the end, she continued tip-toeing about.
Round a great pile of sacks, filled with sugar
or beans, past boxes of tin cans and in and out
among massive pieces of machinery, she wandered,
all the time wondering in a vague sort
of way what was to be the end of it all.</p>
<p>The end to her stay in the store-room came
with lightning-like rapidity. She had just tiptoed
around a huge steel drum of some sort
when all of a sudden there burst upon her ear
a deafening roar that shattered the stillness of
the place.</p>
<p>The next instant a great black dog leaped
at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>He was not three feet from her when, with
an agility that surprised her, she leaped from
box top to box top until she found herself ten
feet above the floor.</p>
<p>But the dog, who appeared to be an utterly
savage beast, could climb too. She could hear
him scrambling and scratching his way up,
growling as he came. Her head was in a
whirl. What was to be done? Suddenly she
realized that just before her, beyond the boxes,
was a window. Dragging her bag after her,
she succeeded in reaching the window. She
found it locked. In her desperation she dropped
her bag and began kicking at the sash.
With a sudden snap the fastenings gave way.
She was caught so unawares that she plunged
straight out of the window.</p>
<p>With a bump that knocked all the wind from
her lungs and most of her senses from her
head, she landed on something hard. Without
being able to help herself, she rolled over once,
then fell again. This time, to her surprise and
consternation, she did not bump; she splashed.
She sank. She rose. With all her nerves alert,
she swam strongly in the stinging lake water.
She had fallen from the narrow pier ledge and
had landed in the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>A white cake of ice loomed up before her.
She swam to it and climbed upon it. What was
to be done? The thermometer was near zero.
She was soaked to the skin, and far from anyone
she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got&mdash;got to get to shore somehow,&rdquo; she
shivered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll freeze here, sure. Freeze in no
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked back at the place from which she
had come. The window was still open. The
dog had stopped barking. She wondered in a
vague sort of way what had become of her
pursuer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and my bag,&rdquo; she chattered. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s
in there.&rdquo; She was coming almost to hate
that bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t get up there anyway,&rdquo; was her final
comment. It was true; between the water line
and the surface of the pier landing was a sheer
wall of cement, eight feet high and smooth as
glass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Her gaze swept a broad circle. Off to her
right was a solid mass of ice which appeared
to reach to shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One swim and then I can walk to land,&rdquo; she
shuddered.</p>
<p>Two steps forward, a sudden plunge, and
again she was in the freezing water.</p>
<p>Once on the ice she dashed away at top speed.
It was a race, a race for her life. Already her
clothing was freezing stiff.</p>
<p>Here she leaped a chasm of black water; there
she tripped over a hole and fell flat; here dodged
a stretch of honeycomb ice and raced across a
broad level stretch.</p>
<p>Almost before she knew it she was alongside
a row of steamships tied up in a channel close
to shore. Then, to her surprise, she caught the
gleam of a light in a cabin on the upper deck
of the smallest boat tied there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a rope cable hanging over the side,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;I&mdash;I could climb it. There
must be someone up there, and&mdash;and a fire. A
fire! Oh, a fire and warmth! I must do it, or
I&rsquo;ll freeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they are strangers&mdash;a man,
two men, maybe a family, but sea folks are
kind people, I&rsquo;m told. They know what it
means to be wet and cold. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll risk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment, hand over hand, she was
making her way up the cable.</p>
<p>Once on deck, she raced along the side
until she came to a stair. Up this she sprang,
then down the side again until she was at the
door of the room where the light still gleamed
into the night.</p>
<p>Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation she banged
on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; came in a distinctly
feminine voice. Florence&rsquo;s heart gave a great
throb of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. Only me,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know me, but let me in. I fell in the lake.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;m free&mdash;freezing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>At once the door flew open and she was
dragged inside. Then the door slammed shut.</p>
<p>For a fraction of a moment the two girls
stood staring at one another, then as in one
voice, they burst out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in the ship&rsquo;s cabin was none other
than Florence&rsquo;s double.</p>
<p>There was no time for explaining. The girl
began tugging away at her double&rsquo;s frozen
garments. Ten minutes later, with her clothing
on a line behind the glowing stove, Florence sat
wrapped in a blanket by the fire, sipping a
cup of cocoa.</p>
<p>For a time she sat looking at the girl who
was so marvelously like herself in appearance.
Then she said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind telling me about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. Guess I ought to. You did me
a good turn. My name&rsquo;s Meg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the man and the woman called
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man and the woman?&rdquo; For a moment
the girl&rsquo;s face was puzzled. Then, &ldquo;Oh yes,
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for a moment as if about to tell
something about the strange man and woman
who had told Florence that the train left at
eleven-thirty. If this had been her intention she
thought better of it, for presently she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and father are dead. Since I
was ten years old I&rsquo;ve lived with my uncle,
mostly on ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how thrilling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe, but you don&rsquo;t learn much on
ships. There&rsquo;s an old saying: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go
to school if you live on a canal boat.&rsquo; Ships
are about as bad. I&rsquo;ve got through eighth
grade, though, and I want to go some more.
That day I took your place and you wore
my clothes I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Florence had heard
the movement of feet outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No friend of mine; not this time of night.
Must be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man? Your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not my friend; an awful man who
wanted the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bag I bought at an auction. My&mdash;my
Christmas surprise. There&mdash;there he is,&rdquo; she
whispered tensely as there came a knock at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Florence struggled to her feet.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Meg had risen. In her hand
was an affair resembling a policeman&rsquo;s club,
only it was made of iron&mdash;a heavy belaying
pin. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t
fancy him, he&rsquo;ll let himself out fast enough.&rdquo;
At the same time there came a rattle at the door
knob. Florence sank back into her chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />THE MYSTERY LADY&rsquo;S NEW ROLE</h2>
<p>Such a party as it was; that one which was
being enjoyed by Lucile and her friends of the
juvenile book corner. Such crisp brown cream
biscuits! Such breast of turkey with cranberry
sauce and dressing! Such pudding! Even
in the days of her childhood at home Lucile had
never seen a more sumptuous feast. All this,
in the midst of the gayest of Christmas spirit,
made the occasion one long to be remembered
by any person whose mind was not too much occupied
by bewitching thoughts of other important
things.</p>
<p>As for Lucile, her mind was indeed engaged
with dreams that were far from the realm of
food and drink. She was thinking of that meeting
she had so long dreamed of and which she
still had the courage to hope might come to
pass, her own meeting with the Mystery Lady
of the Christmas Spirit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t fail to recognize her,&rdquo; she assured
herself, &ldquo;though she be dressed like an Eskimo
or a South Sea Island maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the time came for strolling down the
Boulevard toward the music hall. Lucile stared
at the passing throngs until Laurie teasingly
asked her whether she hoped to see in one of
them the face of a long lost brother.</p>
<p>At last she found herself in the opera chair
of the great hall. Now, at least, she was in the
same room as the Mystery Lady, or soon must
be, for if the Mystery Lady had not entered she
soon would. In ten minutes the first note would
be struck. There was a thrill in that.</p>
<p>It was to be a truly wonderful program, such
a one as the girl had perhaps never listened
to before. And she loved music, fairly adored
it. As she thought how her interest this night
must be divided between the fine music and
the Mystery Lady, she found herself almost
wishing that the Mystery Lady had not brought
into her life so much that was unusual, perplexing
and mysterious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall be able to locate her before
the music begins,&rdquo; she thought to herself.
&ldquo;Then, during a recess, I&rsquo;ll glide up to her and
whisper, &lsquo;You are the Spirit of Christmas.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though she scanned the sea of faces near and
far, not one of them all, save those of her own
little group, was familiar to her.</p>
<p>It was with a little sigh of resignation that
she at last settled back in her seat and allowed
her program to flutter to her lap.</p>
<p>The time for the first number had arrived.
The musicians had taken their places. The
rows of violinists and cornetists, the standing
bass viol player, the conductor with his baton,
all were there. Like soldiers at attention, they
waited for the soloist.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Patricia Diurno, the country&rsquo;s
most talented young pianist, was to lead that
night in the rendition of three master concertos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>There was an expectant lull, then mighty applause.
She was coming. At a door to the
right she appeared. Down a narrow way between
rows of musicians she passed, a tall,
slim, gracefully beautiful lady.</p>
<p>In the center of the stage she paused to bow
in recognition of the applause, then again, and
yet again. Then, turning with such grace as
only a trained musician knows, she moved to
her place and with a slight nod to the leader,
placed her hands upon the keys, then sent
them racing over the keys, bringing forth such
glorious music as only might be learned
beside a rushing brook in the depths of the
forest.</p>
<p>Lucile gripped her seat until her fingers
ached. She strove to remain seated while her
face went white and then was flushed with
color.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is she,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;It
cannot be, yet it is! The same eyes, the same
nose, the same hair. I cannot be mistaken. It
is she! Patricia Diurno, the celebrated, the
most wonderful virtuoso, is the Mystery Lady
and the Spirit of Christmas! And I? How
am I to remain in this seat for two mortal
hours while before me sits a woman pouring
forth bewitching music, a woman who for a
handclasp has the power to make me rich, yes,
rich? Two hundred in gold. How&mdash;how
can I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />MEG WIELDS A BELAYING PIN</h2>
<p>Florence started back at sight of the one
who opened the door in response to Meg&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; It was indeed the small man of
the burning, hawk-like eyes. His disposition
appeared to have been changed by his battle
with the storm. It was plain from the first that
he was now a man not to be trifled with; at
least not by two girls in a lonely ship&rsquo;s cabin
at an hour fast approaching midnight. He
twisted his face into an ugly grin. His smile
was more horrible than a snarl would have
been. His white teeth showed like an angry
dog&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bag!&rdquo; he said in a tone that was a
command. It was evident that he was both
angry and desperate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What bag?&rdquo; said Meg, rising as her companion,
wrapping her blanket closer about her,
slunk further into the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bag!&rdquo; His tone was threatening. He
advanced a step.</p>
<p>Florence could see a deep red stealing up
beneath the natural tan of the daughter of the
sea as she too advanced a step. Meg showed
not the slightest fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bag here.&rdquo; Her hand was behind
her, gripping the belaying pin. &ldquo;No bag
at all unless you call that thing a bag.&rdquo; She
pointed to a canvas duffel bag that hung in
the corner. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine. You can&rsquo;t have it.
You can&rsquo;t have anything in this cabin. You
can&rsquo;t even touch anything or anybody, so you
better get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s word was more like a hiss
than a real expression of the word. At the
same time his teeth were so uncovered that one
might count them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; He advanced another step.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>There came a faint click. Something bright
gleamed in his right hand. A scream came to
Florence&rsquo;s lips, but she did not utter it; she
only sat and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Meg in an even tone, while the
red mounted to the roots of her hair. &ldquo;We
get your kind on the ships too. We get all
kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, like a tiger in the jungle, she leaped
forward. There followed a resounding thwack;
a heavy knife went jangling to the floor. The
stranger&rsquo;s usually dark face turned a sickly
white as, gripping a bruised wrist, he backed
out of the room.</p>
<p>Stepping to the door Meg closed it, but did
not bother to lock it.</p>
<p>Stooping, she picked up the knife and examined
it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said in a matter of fact tone,
&ldquo;is a good knife, much better than the one I
use for slicing bacon. I shall keep it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said, holding it close to Florence,
&ldquo;it has a six-inch blade that locks when you
open it. That&rsquo;s what made it click.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shrank from the thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He had no right to carry it,&rdquo; said Meg,
closing it and dropping it into a chest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a concealed weapon, and they&rsquo;re against the law.
So I&rsquo;ll keep it. Now what about this bag?&rdquo;
she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; smiled Florence, &ldquo;to-morrow&rsquo;s
Christmas. Since I didn&rsquo;t expect a surprise
from anyone, I decided to buy myself one.
So I went down to an auction sale and bought
a bag with &lsquo;contents if any.&rsquo; I meant to buy a
bag anyway, and the &lsquo;contents if any&rsquo; was to
be my surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you get?&rdquo; Meg asked, leaning
forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t look. I meant to keep the bag
until to-morrow. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a Christmas
surprise if I opened it before hand. And now
it&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what did you expect to find?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been anything&mdash;silk scarfs,
some splendid furs, jewelry, a watch&mdash;anything.
And then again,&rdquo; her voice lost its enthusiasm,
&ldquo;it might have contained a man&rsquo;s
collar and a suit of pajamas. I couldn&rsquo;t tell.
Maybe it was just nothing at all. It was awful
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All those things,&rdquo; said Meg, her eyes shining,
&ldquo;or any of them. What a pity! What
fun you would have had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she sat there in silence. Then
suddenly, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s it gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I lost it on the pier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Meg sat up all alert.</p>
<p>Florence told her as best she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get it.&rdquo; Meg dragged her coat from
its hanger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed,
springing up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be afraid of?&rdquo; laughed Meg.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t everybody on the pier know me? Even
the watch-dog knows me? As for your late
friend and follower, I&rsquo;ll just take my belaying
pin along. But I guess he&rsquo;s far enough away
by now. Watch me. I&rsquo;ll be back in half an
hour with that bag&mdash;you wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>With a rush that let in a great gust of cold
air and snow, she was out of the cabin and
away.</p>
<p>The greater part of what she had said to
Florence was true. She did know the dock as
well as any ship on which she had ever sailed.
She knew the watchman and his dog. But,
without her knowledge, there was one person in
authority by the pier that night who did not
know her and this the two girls were to learn
to their sorrow.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Seeing a heavy dressing gown hanging in
the corner, Florence rose and, discarding her
blanket, put this robe on. Then, after feeling of
her slowly drying clothes and moving her skirt
closer to the stove, she walked to the door and
locked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meg may not be afraid of that man,&rdquo; she
whispered to herself, &ldquo;but I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once, as she began walking the floor of
the narrow cabin, her mind went to work on
the many unanswered questions stored away in
her mind. Like some scientist examining specimens,
she drew these questions one at a time
from their mental pigeon holes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Why did this evil looking man with the scar
above his eye want her bag so badly? Suddenly
it occurred to her that he might be a thief, or
a safe blower, and this bag might contain some
of his valuable loot. She remembered reading
of criminals who had locked their booty in trunks
or bags and stored them in some public place
until the police had gotten off their trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;my surprise
will be a disappointment. No matter how
wonderful the contents may be, I will not keep
the least bit of it, but turn it over to the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she thought again, &ldquo;probably
Meg will not be able to get the bag. She may
not be able to get in. Probably the watchman
heard the dog and closed the door and window.
And again, she may find it and that terrible
man may take it from her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>This last she doubted. Meg appeared abundantly
able to take care of herself. Florence
could not but admire her strength and bravery.
It had been magnificent, the way she had put
that villainous intruder to flight. She thought
of what the girl had said about being reared
on a steamship and wanting more education.
She found herself longing to help her. And
why not? She roomed alone. Hers was a large
bed, large enough for two, and she thought she
could get a scholarship for her in the academy
connected with the university. Anyway, it could
be managed somehow. There were elevators in
great hotels close to the school that must be run.
Perhaps she could find her a part time position
on one of these. She would talk to her about
it as soon as opportunity offered.</p>
<p>But who was she, after all? She had been
telling her story when that man broke in upon
them. Would she have told why she asked
Florence to wear her clothes for a half day and
play the role of Meg? If she had, what would
her reason have been?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>During the time that these problems had
passed in review in her memory she had been
walking the cabin floor. Now she came to a
sudden pause. Had she heard footsteps on the
deck below? She thought so. Yes, there it
was again, more plainly now. They were
mounting the stairs. Who could it be? Was
it that man? She shuddered. Springing to
the corner, she put out a hand for Meg&rsquo;s belaying
pin. It was gone. The door was locked,
but the lock looked very weak. What was she
to do? It did not seem possible that Meg
could be back so soon. She had&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>A hand tried the door. What should she
do? Should she let the person in?</p>
<p>Certainly she should, for in Meg&rsquo;s unmistakable
voice she heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Florence threw open the door she saw
at a glance that Meg had the bag and that
the seal was unbroken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; began Florence, &ldquo;you go
home with me to-night. To-morrow is Christmas.
We don&rsquo;t have to get up early. We&rsquo;ll
have something hot to drink and some cakes,
and we&rsquo;ll talk a little. Then, just as the clock
strikes twelve, we&rsquo;ll break the seal to the bag.
Won&rsquo;t that be romantic?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say!&rdquo; said Meg with gleaming
eyes. &ldquo;That would be spiffy! When do we
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once,&rdquo; said Florence, pulling her clothing
from the line.</p>
<p>They were not destined to get away so easily,
however. Unfortunately for them, there was a
person near the entrance to the pier that night
whom Meg did not know, had in fact never
seen.</p>
<p>The wharf to which the boats were tied lay
a distance of about a block south of the entrance
to the pier, and the particular boat on
which Meg had taken up quarters was tied
about two blocks from the end of the pier. In
order to reach the car line they were obliged
to battle their way against the storm, which
had increased in violence, until they were near
the entrance to the pier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>They had covered these three blocks and had
paused to catch their breath and to watch for
the light of a street car boring its way through
the whirl of snow, when a gruff voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where y&rsquo; think y&rsquo;r goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&mdash;&rdquo; Florence hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you got in that bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned to find herself looking into
the face of a young policeman.</p>
<p>She flashed a glance at Meg. That one
glance convinced her that Meg did not know
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where&rsquo;s Tim?&rdquo; Meg faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim McCarty. This is his beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T&rsquo;aint now. It&rsquo;s mine. He&rsquo;s been transferred.
What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he paused to lay a
gloved hand on the travelling bag, &ldquo;since this
is my beat, part of my job&rsquo;s findin&rsquo; out what
comes off them ships at night. What y&rsquo; got in
that bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Florence said the words
impulsively, and regretted them the instant they
were said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; he ceased speaking to stare
at her. &ldquo;Say, sister, you&rsquo;re good! Don&rsquo;t know
what you&rsquo;ve got in that bag! In that case all
I can do is take you to the station for questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said in a kindlier tone after a
moment&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;maybe if you&rsquo;ll unlock it
and let me see what&rsquo;s inside I&rsquo;ll let you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Open it and let him see what was inside?
Florence&rsquo;s head was in a whirl. Open it?
What if her fears proved true? What if it
contained stolen goods? Why, then she would
see the first light of Christmas morning behind
prison bars. Was ever anyone in such a
mess? Did ever a girl pay so dearly for her
own Christmas surprise?</p>
<p>But Meg was speaking: &ldquo;Say, you see here,&rdquo;
she said to the young policeman, her voice a
low drawl. Florence heard them indistinctly
against the roar of the storm. So there she
stood with her back to the wind, clinging tightly
to the handle of her bag and hoping against
hope that she would not be obliged to reveal
her secret there and then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />THE GREAT MOMENT</h2>
<p>The revelation that had come to Lucile as
she sat there listening to the first notes of a
great concerto, led by a famous virtuoso, was
so unusual, so altogether startling, that she felt
tempted to doubt her senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she whispered to herself, &ldquo;I must
be mistaken. There is a resemblance, but she
is not that woman. Imagine a great virtuoso,
one of the famous musicians of our land, being
in a department store at two hours before midnight!
Fancy her going up and down streets,
in and out of the stores and shops dressed in
all manner of absurd costumes, playing the star
role in a newspaper stunt to increase circulation!
How impossible! How&mdash;how utterly absurd!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>She paused for reflection and as she paused,
as if to join her in quiet thought, the great
musician allowed her flying fingers to come to
rest on the keyboard while a violin soloist did
his part.</p>
<p>Then, quick as light, but not too swiftly for
Lucile&rsquo;s keen eyes, she slipped something from
her finger, a something that sent off a brilliant
flash of light. This she placed on the piano beside
the keyboard.</p>
<p>To Lucile, resting as it did against the black
of the ebony piano, this thing stood out like
a circle of stars against the deep blackness of
night. She felt her lips forming the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it there! A hundred people will
see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That dull gray circle with the flashing spot
of light was a ring; Cordie&rsquo;s iron ring with its
diamond setting. There was no longer a single
vestige of doubt in the girl&rsquo;s mind regarding the
identity of the Mystery Lady and the Spirit of
Christmas. They were one and the same, and
together they were Patricia Diurno, the celebrated
virtuoso.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Somehow Lucile got through that two hours
without screaming or jumping from her seat
to hurl herself upon the platform, but she will
never quite know just how she did it. At times
she drove the whole affair from her mind to
think of other unsolved problems&mdash;of Laurie
and the lost author; of Cordie, and of Sam. At
other times she found herself completely absorbed
by the wonderful music which poured
forth.</p>
<p>The majesty of the music grew as the evening
passed. When at last the orchestra struck
out into that masterpiece, Tschaikowsky&rsquo;s Concerto
in B minor, she forgot all else to lose
herself in the marvelous rise and fall of cadent
sound that resembled nothing so much as a
storm on a rockbound coast.</p>
<p>The piano, leading on, called now to the
violin to join in, then upon the cello, the bass
viols, the cornets, the saxophones, the trombones,
the trap-drums, until all together, in perfect
unison, they sent forth such a volume of sound
as shook the very walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>The great virtuoso, forgetful of all else, gave
herself completely to her music. Turning first
this way, then that, she beckoned the lagging
orchestra on until a climax had been reached.</p>
<p>Then, after a second of such silence as is
seldom experienced save after a mighty clap
of thunder, as if from somewhere away in a
distant forest there came the tinkle, tinkle of
the single instrument as her velvet tipped fingers
glided across the keys.</p>
<p>A single violin joined in, then another and
another, then all of them, until again the great
chorus swelled to the very dome of the vast
auditorium.</p>
<p>This was the music that, like the songs of
mermaids of old, charm men into forgetfulness;
that lifts them and carries them away from all
dull care, all sordid affairs of money and all
temptation to the mean, the low and the base.</p>
<p>It so charmed Lucile that for a full moment
after the last note had been struck and the last
echo of applause had died away, she sat there
listening to the reverberations of the matchless
music that still sounded in her soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>When she awoke from her revery it was with
a mighty start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; she exclaimed, leaping
from her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Laurie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patricia Diurno! The Mystery Lady! Spirit
of Christmas! Where has she gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staring to right and left, she found her way
blocked. Then with the nimbleness of an
obstacle racer, she vaulted over four rows of
seats to dash away through the milling crowd
toward the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; she demanded of an attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the Mystery Lady. No, No! Miss
Diurno, the virtuoso.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely in the Green Room, Miss. Who&mdash;who&mdash;is
some of her folks dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! But please show me where the
Green Room is, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Leading the way, he took her to the back
of the stage, through a low door, down a long
passage-way to a large room where a number
of people stood talking.</p>
<p>A glance about the place told her that Miss
Diurno was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the Green Room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Miss. You might ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded to a large man in an evening suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where is Miss Diurno?&rdquo; she asked
timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Diurno did not stay. She left at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Lucile murmured. &ldquo;And my opportunity
gone with it.&rdquo; Sinking weakly into
a chair, she buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>This lasted but a moment; then she was up
and away like the wind. Miss Diurno, the
Mystery Woman, Spirit of Christmas, had gone
out on the Boulevard. She had promised,
through the news columns, to be about the Boulevard
until midnight. There was still a chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>Hurrying back to the now almost deserted
hall, she found Laurie and Cordie waiting for
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, what does this mean?&rdquo; Laurie
laughingly demanded. &ldquo;Did you recognize in
the hands of some violinist the Stradivarius that
was stolen from your grandfather fifty years
ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; Lucile smiled back. &ldquo;I
did discover that someone has vanished, someone
I must find. Yes, yes, I surely must!&rdquo;
She clenched her hands tight in her tense excitement.
&ldquo;I want you two to promise to walk
the Boulevard with me until midnight, that is,
if I don&rsquo;t find her sooner. Will you? Promise
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh promise me,&rsquo;&rdquo; Laurie hummed. &ldquo;Some
contract! What say, Cordie? Are you in
on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds awfully interesting and mysterious.
Let&rsquo;s do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;re with you till the clock
strikes for Christmas morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Lucile led the way out of the hall. They
were soon out in the cool, crisp air of night.
There had been a storm but now the storm had
passed. The night was bright with stars.</p>
<p>To promenade the Boulevard at this hour on
such a night was not an unpleasant task. Out
from a midnight blue sky the golden moon
shone across a broad expanse of snow which
covered the park, while to the left of them, as
if extending their arms to welcome jolly old St.
Nicholas, the great buildings loomed toward the
starry heavens.</p>
<p>The street was gay with light and laughter,
for was not this the night of all nights, the
night before Christmas?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />THE MAN IN GRAY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I know of an odd old custom which might
prove interesting,&rdquo; said Laurie as the three of
them walked arm in arm along the boulevard.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten to what little out of the way
corner of the world it belongs, but anyway, in
the villages of that land, sometime near to midnight,
on Christmas Eve, friends gather about
small tables in their taverns and over the festive
board talk of the year that is gone. The strange
part is this: Just to make it a clearing up
time of unsolved problems, each member of the
group may select one other member of that
group and may ask him three questions. Each
member is pledged to answer all three questions
frankly and truthfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Cordie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d not like to
get caught in a crowd like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad,&rdquo; sighed Laurie. &ldquo;I was about to
propose that a half hour before midnight we
get together to celebrate in just that way. I
think I can pick up a person or two whose
secrets would be of interest to some people I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be wonderful,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile.
&ldquo;But must we select one person, only one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ask him just three questions; no
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile,
pointing her finger first at Cordie, then at
Laurie,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Catch a monkey by the toe,</p>
<p class="t0">If he hollers, let him go,</p>
<p class="t0">Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Laurie, you&rsquo;re my choice,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
ask three questions of you, though goodness
knows I&rsquo;d like to ask them of Cordie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Laurie holding up a warning
finger. &ldquo;There may be someone there who is
more interesting to you than we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one such person in the world,&rdquo;
exclaimed Lucile, &ldquo;and&mdash;and I hope I may
meet her before that hour comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a little surprised at the glances
Laurie and Cordie exchanged and greatly puzzled
by the fact that they did not ask her who
that person was.</p>
<p>Laurie and Cordie gave themselves over to
the gaiety of the night. The blazing light, the
splendid cars that went gliding down the Boulevard,
the magnificent furs worn by those who
chose to promenade the broad sidewalk, were
sights to catch any eye.</p>
<p>They did not hold Lucile&rsquo;s attention. She
had eyes for but one sight, the glimpse of a
single face. What that glimpse would mean to
her! Room rent paid, term bills paid, a warm
coat, other needed clothing, a last minute present
which she had been too poor to purchase,
and a snug little sum in the bank. All these
it would mean, and more; two hundred in gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>But the face did not appear. For an hour
they walked the Boulevard, yet no sight of the
Mystery Lady, she of the Christmas Spirit,
came to them. One matter troubled Lucile more
and more. Often in her search she looked behind
her. More than once, four times in fact,
she had caught sight of a man who walked
always at exactly the same distance behind them.
A tall man, it was, with a long gray coat, a
high collar turned up and cap pulled low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t just because he happens to be
walking in our direction,&rdquo; she told herself with
a little shiver. &ldquo;Twice we have turned and
walked back and once we crossed the street.
But all the time he has been directly behind us.
I wonder what it could mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment there came the clatter of
hoofs and four mounted policemen, clad in
bright uniform, came riding down the Boulevard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big night,&rdquo; exclaimed Laurie.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a special squad of them out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh there&mdash;there he is!&rdquo; exclaimed Cordie.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Dick! That&rsquo;s Patrick O&rsquo;Hara riding
him! Aren&rsquo;t they splendid? And right beside
him is Tim, good old Tim. See! They recognized
me. They touched their hats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Tim?&rdquo; asked Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew?&rdquo; taunted Cordie.
&ldquo;If only you were going to ask your questions
of me you&rsquo;d be sure to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; smiled Laurie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
decided that you shall be the person to answer
my three questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You horrid thing! I shan&rsquo;t go! I&rsquo;m off
your old party!&rdquo; In mock anger, she sprang
away from her companions and went racing on
ahead of them.</p>
<p>Then strange and startling things began to
happen. A long, low-built blue roadster, which
had been creeping along the curb as if looking
for someone, came to a grinding stop. A man
leaped out. A second later a piercing scream
reached the ears of Laurie and Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cordie!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile. &ldquo;Some&mdash;something
terrible! C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>As she said this a gray streak shot past her.
Even in this wild moment of excitement, she
recognized the man who had been dogging their
footsteps and she wondered why she had not
recognized him sooner.</p>
<p>The next second they were in the midst of
things. With wildly beating heart Lucile stared
at the panorama that was enacted before her.
Powerless to aid, she saw Cordie, the innocent
country girl, the center of a battle, snatched
from hand to hand until it seemed the very
life must be torn from her.</p>
<p>First she caught a glimpse of her fighting
frantically but vainly in the grasp of a man.
Lucile recognized him instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hawk-eyed man!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The
one who claimed to be her brother! Quick!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, gripping Laurie&rsquo;s arm until
her fingers cut into the very flesh. &ldquo;Quick!
They&rsquo;re taking her to the auto. They&rsquo;ll carry
her away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>Active as he was, Laurie was not the first
to leap at the hawk-eyed one. A man in gray,
the man who had been following them, sprang
squarely at the captor&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>With a howl of rage and fear the villain
loosed one hand to strike out at his mysterious
assailant. All in vain; the rescuer came straight
on. Striking the captor squarely in the middle,
he bowled him over like a ten-pin. So sudden
was this attack that Cordie was also thrown to
the pavement.</p>
<p>Finding herself free and unharmed, she
sprang to her feet. She felt a hand at her elbow
and turned to look into the face of Laurie
Seymour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;I am safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as she said this she saw Laurie
collapse like an empty sack, and the next instant
grasped from behind by two clutching hands,
she was again whirled toward the kidnapper&rsquo;s
car.</p>
<p>Half blinded by terror, she caught a vision
of police blue that hovered above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat! Patrick O&rsquo;Hara!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>There came the angry crack of an automatic.
Then the figure in blue came hurtling off the
horse to fall at her feet. At the same instant
there was a second catapult-like blow of the
man in gray. Again she was snatched free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiggers! Beat it! Beat it!&rdquo; she heard
in a hoarse whisper. The next instant the door
to the blue car slammed shut and its wheels
began to move.</p>
<p>For three seconds she wavered there, watching
the car move away. Then catching a glimpse of
Patrick O&rsquo;Hara lying at her feet, wounded, perhaps
dead, a great courage came to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must not escape!&rdquo; she screamed.
&ldquo;They shall not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant she leaped into the saddle
of the police horse, Dick. Just as the noble
animal dashed away she felt the solid impact
of someone mounting behind her.</p>
<p>One glance she cast behind her. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she
breathed. It was the man in gray. To Dick she
whispered: &ldquo;All right, Dick, old dear, Go! Go
fast! For the love of Patrick O&rsquo;Hara and
Laurie Seymour; for the love of all that&rsquo;s good
and true, go; go as you never went before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>There was no need to talk to Dick. He was
away like the wind.</p>
<p>It was a moment of high suspense and swift
action; one of those moments when success or
failure hinges on the right move at the right
second.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />THE FINISH</h2>
<p>Dick was no ordinary horse. He was an
unusual horse who had very unusual masters.
The young policeman had spoken the truth when
he said that Pat O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s horse was the
smartest on the force. As Dick felt his young
mistress in the saddle and the man in gray behind
her, he realized that this was not to be a
race, but a fight. He seemed to sense that his
task was to keep in sight of that racing blue
automobile, and not for one instant to lose sight
of it.</p>
<p>Follow it he did, and that at the peril of
his own life and the lives of those who rode.
Now dashing past a low, closed car, now
crowding between two black sedans, now all
but run down by a great yellow car, he forged
straight ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>He not only followed; he actually gained.
Leaning far forward in the saddle, Cordie kept
her eyes upon the fleeing car. Now they
were but three quarters of a block away, now
a half, now a quarter.</p>
<p>It was an exciting moment. Beads of perspiration
stood out upon the tip of Cordie&rsquo;s
nose. The hand that held the reins trembled.
They were gaining, gaining, gaining. Through
narrow passages impossible to a car, old Dick
crowded forward like a fleet, sure-footed dog.
Now a yard he gained, now a rod, and now a
long stretch of open. They were gaining, gaining,
gaining! What were they to do once the
car was overtaken? That Cordie could not tell.
She only knew one thing clearly&mdash;the men
in the car must not escape and she was determined
to prevent their escape.</p>
<p>Then, as they neared a cross street, a man
stepped out on the running board and flashed
an automatic. Aiming deliberately, he fired.
The next instant, with the din of a hundred
sets of brakes screaming in their ears, Cordie,
the horse and the man in gray were piled all
in a heap in the middle of the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>In the midst of all this there came a crash.
What was that? Dared she hope it was the
villains&rsquo; car? At sound of it the man in gray
was up and away like mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she heard an unfamiliar
voice saying. A man from the nearest car
behind them had come to the aid of the girl
and the horse.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>In the meantime, Lucile was passing through
experiences quite as strange.</p>
<p>Laurie Seymour had been knocked unconscious
by a blow on the head. Patrick O&rsquo;Hara
had been shot from his horse. How serious
were the injuries of these, her friends?</p>
<p>To determine this, then to see what might
be done for their relief; this appeared to be her
duty, even though Cordie was in grave danger
still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>Men pressed forward to assist her. They
carried the unconscious ones into the lobby of
a hotel. There they were stretched out upon
davenports and remedies applied by the house
physician.</p>
<p>Lucile was engaged in stopping the flow of
blood from Patrick O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s scalp wound. She
chanced to look up and there, at the edge of
the davenport, she caught sight of a familiar
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Diurno! The Mystery Lady! Spirit
of Christmas! Two Hundred in gold!&rdquo; her
mind registered automatically, but her fingers
held rigidly to their task.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>As Cordie struggled to her feet, after being
plunged from the back of the fallen horse, she
saw the man in gray leap for the side of an
automobile that had crashed into the curb. A
thrill ran through her as she realized that this
was the blue racer. The next instant, after
fairly tearing the door from the hinges, the man
in gray dragged a man out of the blue car,
threw him to the pavement and held him rigidly
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>There came the clatter of horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and
then down sprang good old Tim, the police
sergeant, and his fellow officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad one,&rdquo; growled the one in gray.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got handcuffs, put &rsquo;em on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim hesitated. How was an officer to know
who was in the right? This might be but a
Christmas Eve fight. He had not witnessed the
beginning of this affair.</p>
<p>A hand tugged at his sleeve. &ldquo;If you please,
Tim,&rdquo; came a girlish voice, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, the one
who stole Patrick O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s horse. If you&rsquo;ll believe
me you better take his word for it. He&rsquo;s
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is, eh?&rdquo; rumbled Tim. &ldquo;Little
girl, what you say goes. I&rsquo;d trust you any time.
On they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hawk-eyed man, for it was he that had
been captured (his accomplice had vanished)
made one more desperate effort to escape, but
failed. The handcuffs were snapped on and he
was led away by the younger officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Tim in a sterner voice, &ldquo;tell
me how Pat O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s horse comes to be lyin&rsquo;
there in the street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he shot him,&rdquo; Cordie gulped, pointing
away toward the hawk-eyed man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, did he? Then he should be hung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat&mdash;Patrick O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s sho&mdash;shot too,&rdquo;
Cordie was very near to tears. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t
been for him,&rdquo; she nodded to the figure in gray,
&ldquo;we&mdash;we wouldn&rsquo;t have got him, though Dick
and I would have done our&mdash;our best, for he&mdash;he
shot our good good friend Pat O&rsquo;Hara.&rdquo;
At this, Cordie&rsquo;s long pent up tears came flooding
forth as she hid her face on good old Tim&rsquo;s
broad breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he soothed, patting her
on the shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as bad as you
think. Look! There&rsquo;s old Dick getting to his
feet now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. The man in gray had walked
over to where Dick lay, had coaxed the horse to
get up, and was now leading him limping to
the curb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a flesh wound in the leg,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;Give him a week or ten days and
he&rsquo;ll be on the beat again. Dick, old boy,&rdquo; he
said huskily, &ldquo;and you too, dear little Cordie, I
want to thank you for what you&rsquo;ve done for me.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had my revenge, if a man has a right
to revenge. And it might be they&rsquo;ll find the
fox skins among his plunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the man in gray, just now brimming
with honest tears, were turned toward
Cordie. It was James, the seaman and bundle
carrier!</p>
<p>For a moment he gripped the girl&rsquo;s hand,
then turning to Tim, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look after her? See that she gets
safely back to her friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sure! Sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be getting over to the police station.
They&rsquo;ll be wanting someone to prefer charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was turning to go, but Cordie called him
back. Handing him a slip of paper on which
she had scribbled a number and an address, she
said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Call me on the phone at that number to-morrow,
or else at the Butler House before midnight.
I want to know whether you get those
wonderful silver fox skins back. I&mdash;might
have a customer for them if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make a great little old Christmas
for me if I did,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s going
to be all right anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reading the address Cordie had given him,
James gave a great start. &ldquo;Right on the Gold
Coast!&rdquo; was his mental comment. &ldquo;Out where
there is nothing but palaces and mansions!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />MEG&rsquo;S SECRET</h2>
<p>And what of Florence and Meg? They had
not fared so badly after all. Three minutes
after her first meeting with the young policeman,
Florence was thinking fine things about
Meg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl Meg certainly has a way about
her,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;She does things to people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered what Meg had done to the
young policeman. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t use that iron belaying pin on him
the way she did on that terrible man who had
been following me. No, she didn&rsquo;t do that,
though I suspect she still has it hidden up her
sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>One thing was sure, she had done something
to the young policeman. Florence hadn&rsquo;t heard
what Meg had said, but she did know that one
moment he was frightening the very life out of
her by demanding that she unlock the bag and
show him the contents, which was quite as
much unknown to her as to him, and the next
he had let out a low chuckling laugh and had
told her she might run along. How was she to
account for that?</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t bother much to account for it.
She was too much pleased at being able to go
on her way, and carrying with her the bag with
its secret securely sealed. She would know
about Meg later. Meg had promised to tell.</p>
<p>It was only after they had started on that
she noticed that the storm had blown itself
out and the stars were shining. They were soon
aboard a car bound for home.</p>
<p>An hour later, in the warmth of her room,
and with the bag at their feet, Florence and Meg
sat dreamily thinking their own thoughts.</p>
<p>Florence was not sure that she did not sleep a
little. After the wild experiences of the night,
followed by the battle with the storm, this would
not be surprising.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>She did not sleep long, however, and soon
they fell to talking in the way girls will when
the hour is approaching midnight and the
strenuous experiences of an exciting night are
all at an end.</p>
<p>At an end, did I say? Well, not quite. Perhaps
you might say not at all; for did not the
mysterious brown leather traveling bag, which
had been wondered about and fought over, rest
on the floor at their feet? And was not the
seal unbroken? Did it not still contain Florence&rsquo;s
Christmas secret? And now it was just
twenty-five minutes until midnight, the witching
hour when secrets are revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is just time for you to finish telling
me about yourself before the tower clock strikes
midnight,&rdquo; said Florence, glancing at the small
clock on her desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; laughed Meg with a little shrug of
her wonderful shoulders. &ldquo;There really isn&rsquo;t
much to tell. I&rsquo;ve already told you that since
I was a slip of a child I&rsquo;ve lived on ships with
my uncle. He&rsquo;s a mate. We&rsquo;ve been on a lot
of ships because he often drinks too much and
can&rsquo;t hold his position. He&rsquo;s a big gruff man,
but kind enough in his way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That man who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the man who told you about the train
was not my uncle. That was Tim, a sailor. My
uncle sent him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;at first
I was just sort of a ship&rsquo;s mascot and the
sailors&rsquo; plaything. They rode me on their backs
and carried me, screaming with delight, to the
top of the mast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t last long. They found I could
peel potatoes, so they put me to work. And
I&rsquo;ve been at work ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spread out her hands and Florence
saw that they were as seamed and hard as a
farmer&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind work,&rdquo; Meg continued. &ldquo;I
love it. But I like to learn things, too; like
to learn them out of books, with folks to tell me
what it means. I&rsquo;ve gone to school all I could,
but it wasn&rsquo;t much. I want to go some more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle has signed up for a sea voyage
through the Canal to England. He wanted me
to go along as cook. It&rsquo;s a lumber ship; sure
to be a rough crew. I don&rsquo;t mind &rsquo;em much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something suddenly clattered on the floor. It
was Meg&rsquo;s belaying pin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess you sort of get rough when
you go on the sea,&rdquo; she apologized, smiling.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s partly why I didn&rsquo;t want to go. My
uncle would have made me go that day you
changed places with me, if he&rsquo;d found me. He
likes to have me along because he can get a
better berth himself if he can bring along a
good cook. Good sea cooks are scarce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going now. His train&rsquo;s gone and
he&rsquo;s gone. He left that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was what the man and the woman
meant by the train leaving at eleven-thirty?&rdquo;
asked Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That woman was the matron of the
Seamen&rsquo;s Home. She thought I ought to go.
She didn&rsquo;t know everything. She didn&rsquo;t understand.
I&rsquo;m eighteen. My uncle hasn&rsquo;t any
right to claim me now, and I owe him nothing.
Everything that&rsquo;s been done for me I&rsquo;ve paid for&mdash;paid
with hard labor.&rdquo; Again she spread
her seamed hands out on her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; she said after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
&ldquo;now I&rsquo;m not sure that I know how I&rsquo;m going
to school. It costs a lot, I suppose, and besides
I&rsquo;ve got to live. They let me stay on that ship.
That&rsquo;s something, but it&rsquo;s a long way from any
school, and besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Florence broke in. &ldquo;Let me tell
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then Meg held up a warning finger.
Loud and clear there rang out over the snow
the midnight chimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midnight,&rdquo; whispered Florence, reaching out
a hand for the bewitching bag.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />THREE QUESTIONS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming round all right.&rdquo; It was the
house doctor of the hotel who spoke. Lucile
was still bending over Patrick O&rsquo;Hara. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
regaining consciousness. It&rsquo;s only a scalp wound.
A narrow squeak. An inch to the right, and it
would have got him. He&rsquo;d better go to the
hospital for a little extra petting and patching,
but he&rsquo;s in no danger&mdash;not the least. And as
for your friend Laurie&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a bump on
his head that&rsquo;ll do to hang his hat on for a day
or two. But outside of perhaps a bit of a
headache, he&rsquo;s O. K. Your friends are riding
under a lucky star, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lucky star,&rdquo; thought Lucile. Again she
was free. Had the Lady of the Spirit of
Christmas vanished? No. For once fortune
was with her. As if fascinated by the scene, the
lady still stood there, looking down at Patrick
O&rsquo;Hara.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>Twenty seconds later this lady felt a tug at
her arm as a girl in a low but excited whisper
said: &ldquo;You are the Spirit of Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the lady stared at her for a second,
then a smile lighted her face. &ldquo;Oh yes, why
to be sure! So I am. In the excitement of the
moment I had quite forgotten. Surely I am. So
it is you who win? I am glad, so very, very
glad! I do believe you recognized me five
minutes ago, and that you&rsquo;ve been working over
that brave young policeman ever since, when I
might easily have slipped away. What wonderful
unselfishness! Here is the gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile felt a hard lump of something pressed
into her hand and without looking down knew
that it was ten double eagles. A warm glow
crept over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did see you,&rdquo; she said, after murmuring
her thanks, &ldquo;but you see Patrick O&rsquo;Hara was
wounded trying to rescue a friend of mine. So
how could I desert him for gold?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, how could you? Who was your
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cordie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Cordie? Was she in danger?&rdquo; the
lady exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;Where is she? I
must go to her at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here I am, Auntie!&rdquo; cried an excited
and tremulous young voice. The next moment
little Cordie was enfolded in the arms of the
Mystery Lady, Spirit of Christmas. And this
lady was also Miss Diurno, the great virtuoso,
and Cordie had called her Auntie!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>At exactly a half hour before midnight on
this most exciting Christmas Eve, four people
sat at a round table in the Butler House. There
was a distinguished looking lady, a young man
with a bump on his head that made his hair
stand up in a circle, a young lady of college age,
and a girl in her teens. They were the Mystery
Lady, Laurie Seymour, Lucile and Cordie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>Ice cream and cakes had been served; coffee
was on the way. Laurie had finished explaining
to Miss Diurno the ancient custom of some
long forgotten land, that of answering, truthfully,
three questions round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Laurie, old dear,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;why
should I ask three questions of you? I already
know far too much about you for my own good
peace of mind; and as for Cordie, I fancy I
know more about her than she knows about
herself. I move we amend the custom a little.
How would it do to allow our friend Lucile to
ask all the questions&mdash;three around for each
of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That would be darling!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lucile, fairly leaping from her chair. &ldquo;You are
all so very, very mysterious. There are so
many, many things I&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; exclaimed Laurie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; smiled Cordie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; said Miss Diurno,
whose very greatness as a musician so affected
Lucile that she found it very difficult to be
her usual frank and friendly self. &ldquo;Miss Lucile,
you may have ten minutes for thinking up
questions. Then, over our coffee, we will answer
them. But remember, only three questions, three
around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only three,&rdquo; Lucile whispered to herself.
&ldquo;And there is so much I want to know! So
much I just <i>must</i> know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she sat there, with her head all in a whirl,
trying in vain to form the questions she wished
to ask, one conviction was borne in upon her.
She had been the center of a plot, a very
friendly plot, she was sure of that, and one
that had been entered into the truest of Christmas
spirit. Cordie had known Miss Diurno all
the time, in fact had only a short time ago
called her Auntie. Miss Diurno had called
Laurie by a familiar name&mdash;she had said &ldquo;Old
dear.&rdquo; She must have known him a long time.
Then surely, to be a friend to such an one, he
must be something rather great himself. And
Cordie? She could scarcely be the simple little
country girl she had thought her. Lucile&rsquo;s
mind was in such a daze that when the great
pianist tapped her wrist watch and said:
&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up. Who&rsquo;s the first?&rdquo; she had not
formed one question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Age before beauty,&rdquo; laughed Cordie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s me?&rdquo; smiled Miss Diurno. &ldquo;I
am ready to be questioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Lucile. &ldquo;Why
did you, who are such a very great musician,
undertake the humble task of assisting in a
newspaper stunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little girl,&rdquo; said Miss Diurno, a very
mellow note of kindness creeping into her voice,
&ldquo;there are no great people in the world, and
there are no truly humble tasks. All people
who are truly great are also very humble. Tasks
called humble by men may be truly great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have asked me a question. The
reason I accepted that newspaper task was this:
Marie Caruthers, my very best school chum
and lifetime friend, went in for newspaper work.
She was to have done the stunt, but just when
the time came she was taken to the hospital. So
I volunteered to take her place. And it was
fun, heaps of it! Just imagine having the whole
city looking for you and yet to be walking in
and out among the people every day and not
a single one of them recognizing you at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there were times enough when I got
into plenty of trouble. That night in the department
store was a scream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much of a scream for me,&rdquo; grumbled
Laurie. &ldquo;I gave you my pass-out. Then after
knocking nearly all the skin off my hand going
down the bundle chute, I had to sleep in the
basement, with corrugated paper for mattress
and covers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Laurie!&rdquo; smiled Miss Diurno.
&ldquo;But you deserved all you got. Think of the
role you have been playing! Think! Just
think!&rdquo; laughed the pianist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, turning to Lucile to
explain her presence in the store that night, &ldquo;I
had promised to be in the store six hours that
day. Then I allowed myself to become absorbed
in some new music, and the first thing
I knew it was getting late in the afternoon and
my six hours not yet begun. Of course there
was nothing for it but to remain in the store
after closing hours. I hid in that long narrow
place, wedged myself between book shelves and
stands, then stuck there until the clock struck
ten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t realized that it would be hard to
get out. When I did think of it I was terror-stricken.
To think of remaining in that great
vault of a store all night! Ugh! It gives me
the shivers to think of it, even now. I haven&rsquo;t
the least notion what I would have done if I
hadn&rsquo;t come upon good old Laurie. He gave
me his pass-out. You saw him do it. I knew
this at the time, and I think you were a great
little sport not to raise a big rumpus, especially
after I took your coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you take my coat?&rdquo; asked Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid I couldn&rsquo;t get out in that fur
cape. And besides, I wanted just such a coat
as yours for the next day&rsquo;s stunt. So I traded
with you. That was fair enough, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traded? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I said, just traded, and thanked
you for the opportunity. And now, my dear,
that makes three questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; Lucile cried excitedly. &ldquo;Why no,
I&rsquo;ve only asked one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to the crowd,&rdquo; beamed the great
little lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three! Three!&rdquo; agreed Laurie and Cordie
with one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why then I shall be obliged to take
up someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heads I&rsquo;m next, tails I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Laurie,
tossing a coin in air. &ldquo;Heads! I&rsquo;m it. Do
your worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Jefrey Farnsworth?&rdquo; Lucile asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed Laurie. &ldquo;See what I
get into right away! Well, since it is Christmas
Eve, I dare not tell a lie. I am forced to
inform you that the only gentleman at this
table was given that name at his birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are Jefrey Farnsworth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned Cordie, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve used
up two questions already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>Lucile was silent for a moment, then with a
smile she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you take an assumed name, and
who was Sam, and did he have anything to do
with your selling books, and why were you
afraid of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That business of hanging your question on
a string is great stuff,&rdquo; laughed Laurie. &ldquo;I
recommend that you try it out on Cordie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in a more sober tone, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see it was this way: My publishers
saw that my book was going to go across rather
big and, since I was to benefit financially in its
success, they thought it would be nice for me
to have a part in making it a still greater&mdash;um&mdash;um,
triumph. So they cooked up that idea
about my speaking to ladies&rsquo; clubs. I knew I
couldn&rsquo;t do it, but I knew also that Sam would
make me do it if I stuck around. Everyone
does what Sam wants them to do; that is, they
do if they stay where he is.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I said to myself, &lsquo;If I must help sell
my books, I&rsquo;ll do it in a straightforward way
right over the counter. I&rsquo;ll get a job.&rsquo; I did.
And just so Sam couldn&rsquo;t find me and drag me
away, I came to this city and took an assumed
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s a sort of salesman for my publishers;
that is, he sells books when he isn&rsquo;t
promoting authors. When I saw him in the
store that time I just naturally had to disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, though,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that even
Sam is satisfied. We sold two thousand copies
of &lsquo;Blue Flames,&rsquo; you and Donnie and Rennie
and all the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for my knowing the lady of the hour,&rdquo;
he smiled, touching the arm of Miss Diurno,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known her for some time. And on some
future lovely day in June, when my income has
come to be half as much as hers, we&rsquo;re going
to move into a certain lovely little vine covered
cottage I know about and set up a nest all for
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I come
to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the great musician, &ldquo;you
may come and live with us, both you and Cordie,
live with us forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cordie, your turn to be questioned,&rdquo; said
Laurie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Cordie, throwing her arms
about Lucile and hiding her face in the folds of
her dress. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to ask me questions.
I don&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t! I just want to confess
how mean I have been and what an unkind
trick I have played on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Cordie!&rdquo; Lucile consoled her.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been mean to me at all. You&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
been the dearest kind of a little pal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I have! I let you think I was a poor
little girl from the country, when I wasn&rsquo;t at
all. I allowed you to spend money on me and
pay all the room rent when I just knew you
thought you were going to have to live on milk
toast all next term of school. And I never even
offered to do my share at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But if you only knew,&rdquo; she raced on, &ldquo;how
good it seemed to have one friend who wasn&rsquo;t
one bit selfish, who didn&rsquo;t want a lot of things
for herself and who was willing to do things
for other people when she really needed just
plain ordinary things for herself. If you only
knew! If you only did!&rdquo; Cordie&rsquo;s voice rose
shrill and high. She seemed about to burst
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, dear little pal!&rdquo; whispered
Lucile. &ldquo;I think I understand. But tell me,
why did you take a job as wrapper when you
really wasn&rsquo;t poor and didn&rsquo;t need the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; laughed Cordie, now quite herself
again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had to ask for any in
my whole life! My father owns a third of that
big store we worked in, and a lot besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dick?&rdquo; said Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rode Dick on my father&rsquo;s estate. It
nearly broke my heart when they sold him. My
father gave up his stables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me why you wanted
to work in the store.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see that day, the first day you
ever saw me, just for fun I had dressed up in
plain old fashioned clothes and had gone
downtown for a lark. Then I did that foolish
fainting stunt. I really, truly fainted. And
that man, that hawk-eyed man&mdash;&rdquo; she shuddered,
&ldquo;must have recognized me. He must
have known he could get a lot of money from
father if only he could carry me away. Anyway
he tried it and you&mdash;saved me!&rdquo; She
paused to give Lucile another hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are coming to my house for Christmas
dinner, and I&rsquo;ve kept track of everything in a
little book and I&rsquo;m going to pay you every cent,
truly I am, and we&rsquo;ll have the best time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was going to tell you,&rdquo; she paused
in her mad ramble, &ldquo;I was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Miss Diurno held up a hand for
silence, &ldquo;Cordie, someone is paging your name.
Here! Over here!&rdquo; she called to the bell boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>The three sat in silence until Cordie returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she
came bounding toward them. &ldquo;It was James,
my friend the bundle carrier at the phone.
They&rsquo;ve worked fast. They raided the room of&mdash;of
the hawk-eyed man and they found James&rsquo;
silver fox skins. And Auntie, I&rsquo;m going to
have father buy them as a present for you.
Won&rsquo;t that be g-grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it might,&rdquo; smiled her aunt,
giving her arm an affectionate squeeze. &ldquo;But,
my dear, you hadn&rsquo;t finished telling Lucile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s a short story now. When I saw
how good and kind you were,&rdquo; Cordie said,
turning to Lucile, &ldquo;when I saw the work there
was to do and everything, I was fascinated. I
just wanted to play I was just what you thought
me to be. So I called up my father and made
him let me do it. That was all there was
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Auntie!&rdquo; she exclaimed, turning to
Miss Diurno. &ldquo;Why did you steal my badge
of serfdom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My badge of serfdom, the iron ring. In
olden days serfs wore iron collars; now it&rsquo;s an
iron ring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your iron ring!&rdquo; laughed her aunt.
&ldquo;I needed it for my stunt. But here it is; you
may have it and welcome, diamond and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall keep you ever and always,&rdquo; murmured
the girl, pressing the ring to her lips.
&ldquo;I shall cherish you in memory of a grand
and glorious adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you understood,&rdquo; said Miss
Diurno, turning to Lucile, &ldquo;that you are to keep
the fur lined cape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you must! It was the one extravagance
that I made the paper pay for. I
traded with you, and have lost yours, so there
is really no other way out. Besides,&rdquo; her voice
softened, &ldquo;I want you to accept it as a gift from
me, a little token of appreciation for your
many kindnesses to my little niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile&rsquo;s head was in a whirl. She found
herself unable to think clearly of all her good
fortune. A great musician, an author, and a
very rich girl for her friends; a magnificent
cape of midnight blue and fox skin, and two
hundred dollars in gold! Merry Christmas!
What a Christmas it would be indeed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispered Miss Diurno. From
some distant room there came the slow, sweet
chimes of a clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Striking midnight,&rdquo; she whispered. Then
from far and near there came the clanging of
church bells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas morning!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Diurno, springing to her feet. &ldquo;Merry, Merry
Christmas to all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!&rdquo; they
chorused in return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />WHAT THE BROWN BAG HELD</h2>
<p>At the precise moment that the four companions
in the great city hotel rose to offer each
other their Christmas greetings, Florence and
Meg stood over the fascinating bag which had
cost Florence so much worry and trouble. As
Florence felt in her purse for the key she found
herself wondering for the hundredth time what
it might contain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas, my Christmas secret,&rdquo; she
whispered. Then, as she felt the key within
her grasp, she turned resolutely to the task.
Although she had looked forward to this hour
with pleasure, now it seemed to hold something
of a feeling of fear. She was opening
a bag which had belonged to another. What
might it not contain?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>With trembling fingers she broke the seal
which had so long and faithfully hidden the
secret. Then, with a steadier hand, she inserted
the key.</p>
<p>For a full moment after that she stood there
in silence. She was saying to herself over and
over again: &ldquo;There is nothing, nothing, nothing
in there that I shall care for. Nothing,
nothing, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus fortified against disappointment, she at
last turned the key, pulled the flap and threw
the bag wide open.</p>
<p>The first look brought a glimpse of a bit of
negligee. Nothing so exciting in this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well anyway,&rdquo; sighed Florence, &ldquo;it&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
a man&rsquo;s bag. It could not have belonged
to that&mdash;that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Meg, &ldquo;it couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one Florence removed the few articles
of clothing that had been packed in the bag.
These were of fine texture and well made. But
beneath these was something to bring an exclamation
to her lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>Putting out her hand, she lifted to view a
roll of silk cloth, of royal blue, and of such
thinness and fineness as she had seldom seen in
all her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yards and yards of it,&rdquo; she breathed, throwing
it before her in bright, billowy waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look!&rdquo; cried Meg. &ldquo;Batik!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true; beneath the silk was a bolt of
batik. This Meg took to the light and examined
it with great care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s genuine,&rdquo; she whispered at last. &ldquo;Not
the sham stuff that is made in American factories,
but the kind that dark faced women dye
with great skill and much labor, dipping again
and again in colors such as we know nothing of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence examined the cloth, then spread it
over the back of a chair. Then she sat down.
There was a puzzled look on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very beautiful,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;One could
not hope to buy a more perfect present, sight
unseen, but I&rsquo;m wondering why a man should
be willing to trace me down at infinite pains and
then follow me in the face of danger and in the
teeth of a storm for the sake of getting possession
of two rolls of cloth. That seems strange.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does seem odd,&rdquo; said Meg. &ldquo;But wait!
Here&rsquo;s something else.&rdquo; She drew two long
pasteboard tubes from the bottom of the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose?&rdquo; whispered Florence.
Inserting one finger in the first tube she twisted
it about, then began drawing it out. A roll of
papers appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papers,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Probably important
papers; deeds, stocks and bonds, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine her surprise when, having drawn
the papers out and partly unrolled them, she
found them to be pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pictures!&rdquo; she exclaimed in disgust. &ldquo;And
only printed pictures at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such wonderful pictures!&rdquo; exclaimed
Meg, holding one out to view.</p>
<p>It was indeed a wonderful picture, one of
those vague, misty things that came out of the
great war. This one was of a smoke clouded
cannon in the foreground, belching black smoke
and fire, and in the midst of the smoke, forming
herself out of it, a most beautiful black-haired
woman, her eyes burning, her hands
clawing, leaping straight at the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a wonderful picture,&rdquo; said Florence
when they had gazed at it in silence for a time.
&ldquo;But after all, it is only a print, and can&rsquo;t be
worth much. I still don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; Meg broke in, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s unroll
them all and weight them down on the floor
with books so we can have a good look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; said Florence, beginning to
unroll one.</p>
<p>It was truly a remarkable collection of pictures
which at length carpeted the floor. War
pictures, all of them, and all displaying that
strong spiritual interpretation which was so
common in pictures of those times. A French
airplane falling in flames and beneath it an angel
waiting to bear away the soul of the brave
aviator; the American flag drifting in the
clouds and seen from afar by a French soldier
in the trenches; such were the themes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;re grand?&rdquo; said Meg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Florence responded, &ldquo;but after all,
they are only prints of the work of some great
master. &lsquo;Veny LeCarte&rsquo;&rdquo; she read at the bottom
of one. &ldquo;I believe, yes, they&rsquo;re all by the
same man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time they sat there in silence.
They were at last about to rise when there came
a light rap at their door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; came from outside. &ldquo;I saw
the light in the room as I was passing and
thought I&rsquo;d come up to say &lsquo;Good morning and
Merry Christmas.&rsquo;&rdquo; It was Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas yourself,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence,
throwing wide the door. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Meg, Lucile; and Meg, that&rsquo;s Lucile,&rdquo;
she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Florence, where in the world did you
get those marvelous etchings?&rdquo; exclaimed Lucile
after she shook hands with Meg. &ldquo;And
why do you carpet your floor with them? I
nearly stepped on one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Etch&mdash;etchings!&rdquo; stammered Florence.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mine&mdash;at least I bought them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bought them! You? You bought them!&rdquo;
Lucile stared incredulous. Then, bending over,
she read the name at the bottom of one. After
that her eyes roved from picture to picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veny LeCarte,&rdquo; she murmured as if in a
dream. &ldquo;And she says she bought them!&rdquo;
She dropped weakly into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;do you know
who Veny LeCarte was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-o.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. He was one of the most
famous artists of France. He made etchings
of the war. No one could surpass him. And
unlike his fellow artists, who allowed a hundred
copies to be made from each plate, he allowed
but twenty. Then the plates were destroyed.
He made these pictures. You have nearly all
of them. And then he went away to the war,
and was killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that time his etchings have been
much prized and have brought fabulous prices.
Oh, Florence, tell me how you got them!
Surely, surely you didn&rsquo;t buy them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Florence unsteadily, hardly
knowing whether to laugh or cry, &ldquo;but I
bought them in a strange way. I&rsquo;ll tell you
about it.&rdquo; Then she told Lucile the whole
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those pictures,&rdquo; she said at the end,
&ldquo;are the reason that man dogged my footsteps.
It had not been his bag. He had not owned
the pictures, but some way he had learned that
the pictures were in this bag. He had meant
to buy the bag, but arrived too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour was late. What did that matter?
To-morrow was Christmas. Florence set about
brewing some cocoa, and over the cups the girls
engaged in such a talk fest as they had not
enjoyed for months. Everything that had happened
to Lucile during those eventful weeks,
from the first night to the last, had to be told.
The wonderful cape, with its white fox collar,
must be displayed. The gold coins must be
jingled and jangled. Meg&rsquo;s story must be told
all over again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>After that, problems yet unsolved must be
discussed. Was the hawk-eyed man who had
attempted to gain possession of Florence&rsquo;s bag
the same one who had attempted to kidnap
Cordie?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That question,&rdquo; said Lucile to Florence,
&ldquo;can only be settled by you going down to
the police station and looking at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, it will never be answered,&rdquo;
said Florence, with a shudder.</p>
<p>Would a romance spring up between the rich
girl Cordie and the gallant young policeman,
Patrick O&rsquo;Hara? Who could tell? So the
conversation rambled on until early morning.
At last Lucile hurried away and Meg and Florence
prepared for three winks.</p>
<p>As Florence, with Meg by her side, was
drifting off to sleep, she heard Meg say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow I must go back to the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you&rsquo;ll not,&rdquo; she roused up to protest.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay right here to-morrow and
every day. And you&rsquo;re going to school, too.
I need you to guard all my&mdash;my treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>How the pictures came to be in the bag
which Florence had purchased at the sale, will
probably always remain a secret. Perhaps the
one who left the bag did not realize the value
of the etchings. Who knows what may have
been the reason? But they were truly valuable,
and Florence learned this for certain on the
following Monday. Later she sold them to
a dealer for a good round sum. This money
went far, not only to smooth the road to her
own education, but to enable her to give Meg
many a lift along the way.</p>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">www.gutenberg.org/license</a>.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h3>

<p class="pg">1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p class="pg">1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p class="pg">1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p class="pg">1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p class="pg">This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

<p class="pg">1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p class="pg">1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p class="pg">1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p class="pg">1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3 class="pg">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3 class="pg">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
